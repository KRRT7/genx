Neutron reflectivity video tutorial

There is also a tutorial series I made that was published through ORNL, some parts are specific to the MagRef instrument:

* `Tutorial 1 - Introduction to GenX for fitting polarized neutron data <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFiZgzWwcBY>`__
* `Tutorial 2 - Fitting x-ray together with neutron dat <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTxQmfSIYoE>`__
* `Tutorial 3 - Polarization analysis, multilayers and constrains <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiN1BStl8lc>`__
* `Tutorial 4 - Advanced scripting <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5BLaWXODro>`__

A user of GenX, Mingda Li, has created a video tutorial that goes through the fitting of a polarized neutron data set.
