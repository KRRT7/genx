	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Oxygen vacancy (VO) defects are common in oxide semiconductors, which
<br>   are generally believed to be double-edged in detectors. They contribute
<br>   to a photo gain effect and consequently high responsivity. However, VO
<br>   defects typically result in high dark current and long persistent
<br>   photoconductivity (PPC), severely affecting the weak-light detecting and
<br>   quick refreshing abilities. Here, a simple two-terminal architecture is
<br>   constructed on amorphous Ga2O3 double layers. By adopting a periodic
<br>   bias-switching working method, we found that the PPC is stably
<br>   suppressed and a robustly high refresh rate is achieved, accompanied
<br>   with the ultra-high photo-to-dark current ratio (> 109), detectivity
<br>   (8.7x10(17 )Jones) and UV-vis rejection ratio (> 10(8)). The combination
<br>   of VO- gradient double-layer structure and new working method enables an
<br>   unimpeded transportation of photo generated electrons under light
<br>   illumination and a swift block of the trap-released electrons in dark.
<br>   The methodology may be hopefully extended to other oxide semiconductors
<br>   for high-performance photodetection.</td>

<br>   amitriptyline hydrochloride (AMT) on a

<br>   supported on a silica surface have been investigated using a combination
<br>   of neutron reflectometry and quartz crystal microbalance with
<br>   dissipation monitoring. Adding AMT solutions with concentrations 3, 12,
<br>   and 50 mM leaves the lipid bilayer mainly intact and we observe most of
<br>   the AMT molecules attached to the head-group region of the outer bilayer
<br>   leaflet. Virtually no AMT penetrates into the hydrophilic head-group
<br>   region of the inner leaflet close to the silica surface. By adding 200
<br>   mM AMT solution, the lipid bilayer dissolved entirely, indicating a
<br>   threshold concentration for the solubilization of the bilayer by AMT.
<br>   The observed threshold concentration is consistent with the observation
<br>   that various bilayer structures abruptly transform into mixed AMT-DOPC
<br>   micelles beyond a certain AMT-DOPC composition. Based on our
<br>   experimental observations, we suggest that the penetration of drug into
<br>   the phospholipid bilayer, and subsequent solubilization of the membrane,

<br>   The liquefaction-solidification transition is monitored in real-time by

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Bent-core mesogens (BCMs) are a class of thermotropic liquid crystals
<br>   featuring several unconventional properties. However, the interpretation
<br>   and technological exploitation of their unique behavior have been
<br>   hampered by the difficulty of controlling their anchoring at surfaces.
<br>   To tackle this issue, we report the nanoscale structural
<br>   characterization of BCM films prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett
<br>   technique. Even though BCMs are quite different from typical amphiphilic
<br>   molecules, we demonstrate that stable molecular films form over water,
<br>   which can then be transferred onto silicon substrates. The combination
<br>   of Brewster angle microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray
<br>   reflectivity measurements shows that the molecules, once transferred
<br>   onto a solid substrate, form a bilayer structure with a bottom layer of
<br>   flat molecules and an upper layer of upright molecules. These results
<br>   suggest that Langmuir-Blodgett films of BCMs can provide a useful means
<br>   to control the alignment of this class of liquid crystals.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Orbital anisotropy at interfaces in magnetic heterostructures has been
<br>   key to pioneering spin-orbit-related phenomena. However, modulating the
<br>   interface's electronic structure to make it abnormally asymmetric has
<br>   been challenging because of lack of appropriate methods. Here, the
<br>   authors report that low-energy proton irradiation achieves a strong
<br>   level of inversion asymmetry and unusual strain at interfaces in
<br>   [Co/Pd] superlattices through nondestructive, selective removal of
<br>   oxygen from Co3O4/Pd superlattices during irradiation. Structural
<br>   investigations corroborate that progressive reduction of Co3O4 into Co
<br>   establishes pseudomorphic growth with sharp interfaces and atypically
<br>   large tensile stress. The normal component of orbital to spin magnetic
<br>   moment at the interface is the largest among those observed in layered
<br>   Co systems, which is associated with giant orbital anisotropy
<br>   theoretically confirmed, and resulting very large interfacial magnetic
<br>   anisotropy is observed. All results attribute not only to giant orbital
<br>   anisotropy but to enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling owing to the
<br>   pseudomorphic nature at the interface. They are strongly supported by
<br>   the observation of reversal of polarity of temperature-dependent
<br>   Anomalous Hall signal, a signature of Berry phase. This work suggests
<br>   that establishing both giant orbital anisotropy and strong spin-orbit
<br>   coupling at the interface is key to exploring spintronic devices with
<br>   new functionalities.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, the optimal thickness of SiC film for an antireflection
<br>   coating was determined by computer simulations using Lumerical FTDT and
<br>   SCOUT software. The simulation was carried out for the SiC/MgF2 system,
<br>   where silicon carbide films were deposited at a magnetron power of 100,
<br>   150, 200, 250 W, while the thickness of the magnesium fluoride films
<br>   remained unchanged and amounted to 130 nm. The simulation results showed
<br>   that the optimal parameters for the synthesis of SiC antireflection
<br>   layer are 100 W/50 nm. With these parameters, the reflection is less
<br>   than 3% in the widest wavelength range of 475-1020 nm. The dependence
<br>   of the physical properties of the synthesized films on the power of the
<br>   magnetron is investigated. Using reflection and transmission
<br>   spectroscopy it was experimentally revealed that a decrease in the
<br>   magnetron power from 250 to 100 W leads to a decrease in the refractive
<br>   index. According to our results the best antireflection effect can be
<br>   achieved with SiC/MgF2 coatings when SiC films are deposited at 100 W
<br>   magnetron power. The reflectance spectra are consistent with the
<br>   simulation spectra, especially in the 475-1020 nm range, where the
<br>   surface reflects only 0.2-3.0% of the incident light. The obtained
<br>   results are explained by the correlation between the structural
<br>   properties, composition of amorphous silicon carbide films and
<br>   antireflection properties.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The deuterium-induced changes of the optical transmission in Fe/V (001)
<br>   and Cr/V (001) superlattices are found experimentally to be dominated by
<br>   the volume changes of the vanadium layers and thus indirectly linked to
<br>   concentration. The deuterium-induced expansion is 67% larger in Cr/V
<br>   2/14 monolayers (ML) as compared to Fe/V 2/14 ML. This large difference
<br>   can be explained by a difference in the site of deuterium from
<br>   tetrahedral in Fe/V to octahedral in Cr/V. First-principles calculations
<br>   based on this assumption give quantitative agreement with both the
<br>   measured optical transmission and the deuterium-induced expansion
<br>   coefficient. Placing hydrogen in the middle of the vanadium layers
<br>   results in total energies at 0 K that favor tetrahedral occupancy at low
<br>   concentrations, although the energy difference is of the order of the
<br>   thermal energy available in the experiments. Hence small changes in
<br>   strain, defect concentration, and/or vibrational spectrum of the
<br>   superlattices may tip the balance to octahedral occupancy at low
<br>   concentrations. Given this link to concentration and the linear scaling,
<br>   optical transmission can, therefore, be used in a straightforward way to
<br>   obtain pressure-composition isotherms also in thin metal films that do
<br>   not undergo metal-insulator transitions upon hydrogenation.</td>

<br>   metal-oxide-semiconductor (pMOS) devices. However, unavoidable GeOx
<br>   formation at the high-kappa/Si1-xGex interface with high Ge-contents
<br>   (HGC) has caused high interfacial trap density, posing a challenge for
<br>   employing the HGC Si(1-x)Ge(x )as the channel in sub-3 nm complementary
<br>   MOS technology. In this work, we have deposited epitaxial Si (epi-Si) of
<br>   six monolayer thickness on Si1-xGex at temperatures of 260-280 degrees C
<br>   to minimize Ge diffusion and segregation. Si1-xGex layers with a wide
<br>   range of HGC (0.5 < x <= 0.8) were grown to investigate the
<br>   effectiveness of the epi-Si on the Si1-xGex To minimize the GeOx
<br>   formation caused by the oxidation of the segregated Ge on the epi-Si
<br>   surface, HfO2 was subsequently deposited via e-beam evaporation on the
<br>   epi-Si. The measurements using reflection high-energy electron
<br>   diffraction, high-resolution synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction,
<br>   and scanning transmission electron microscopy with high-angle
<br>   annulardark-field imaging have revealed the high crystallinity of the
<br>   epi-Si, the Si1-xGex layers, and abrupt interfaces of the
<br>   high-kappa/epi-Si/Si1-xGex layers. The well-controlled interfaces have
<br>   enabled the achievement of low interfacial trap densities (D-it) of
<br>   (3-6) x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) in these high-kappa/epi-Si/(HGC)Si1-xGex
<br>   samples. The minimum D-it values remained at 3 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2)
<br>   regardless of the Ge content, confirming the effective passivation of
<br>   the low-temperature deposited epi-Si. By extracting the effective charge
<br>   sheet densities for the Si1-xGex gate stacks via examination of
<br>   capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis with decreasing stress voltage in

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic systems exhibiting spin-canted states have garnered much
<br>   attention recently for their promising rich exotic properties driven by
<br>   the real-space spin textures and competing magnetic orders. In this
<br>   study, we present the structural and magnetic properties of hexagonal 60
<br>   nm MnPtGa epitaxial thin films grown by magnetron sputtering on
<br>   Al2O3(0001) single-crystalline substrates. The MnPtGa film crystallizes
<br>   in the centrosymmetric P6(3)/mmc (No. 194) space group, showing
<br>   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along the c-axis, with a Curie
<br>   temperature T-C = 263 K. In addition, the MnPtGa film undergoes a spin
<br>   reorientation transition at T-sr = 160 K. We investigated the MnPtGa
<br>   magnetic ground states using single-crystal neutron diffraction. A
<br>   structurally forbidden (001) magnetic Bragg reflection emerges below
<br>   T-sr, indicating the existence of a spin-canted state, where the
<br>   magnetic moments align ferromagnetically perpendicular to the basal
<br>   plane, and a non-zero in-plane component exhibits an antiferromagnetic
<br>   ordering along the c-axis. At 2 K, the refined magnetic moments of Mn
<br>   are mu(z) = 4.2(4) mu(B) and mu(x) = 1.5(3) mu(B), projected onto the
<br>   c-axis and basal plane, respectively. Hence, we determined a 20 degrees
<br>   Mn spin canting angle off from the c-axis. (C) 2022 Author(s).</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The integration of passivating contacts based on a highly doped
<br>   polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer on top of a thin silicon oxide
<br>   (SiOx) layer has been identified as the next step to further increase
<br>   the conversion efficiency of current mainstream crystalline silicon
<br>   (c-Si) solar cells. However, the interrelation between the final
<br>   properties of poly-Si/SiOx contacts and their fabrication process has
<br>   not yet been fully unraveled, which is mostly due to the challenge of
<br>   characterizing thin-film stacks with features in the nanometric range.
<br>   Here, we apply in situ X-ray reflectometry and diffraction to
<br>   investigate the multiscale (1 angstrom-100 nm) structural evolution of
<br>   poly-Si contacts during annealing up to 900 degrees C. This allows us to
<br>   quantify the densification and thinning of the poly-Si layer during
<br>   annealing as well as to monitor the disruption of the thin SiOx layer at
<br>   high temperature >800 degrees C. Moreover, results obtained on a broader
<br>   range of thermal profiles, including firing with dwell times of a few
<br>   seconds, emphasize the impact of high thermal budgets on poly-Si
<br>   contacts' final properties and thus the importance of ensuring a good
<br>   control of such high-temperature processes when fabricating c-Si solar
<br>   cells integrating such passivating contacts. Overall, this study
<br>   demonstrates the robustness of combining different X-ray elastic
<br>   scattering techniques (here XRR and GIXRD), which present the unique
<br>   advantage of being rapid, nondestructive, and applicable on a large
<br>   sample area, to unravel the multiscale structural evolution of poly-Si
<br>   contacts in situ during high-temperature processes.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: With the scaling of lateral dimensions in advanced transistors, an
<br>   increased gate capacitance is desirable both to retain the control of
<br>   the gate electrode over the channel and to reduce the operating
<br>   voltage'. This led to a fundamental change in the gate stack in 2008,
<br>   the incorporation of high-dielectric-constant HfO2 (ref. 2 ), which
<br>   remains the material of choice to date. Here we report HfO2-ZrO2
<br>   superlattice heterostructures as a gate stack, stabilized with mixed
<br>   ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order, directly integrated onto Si
<br>   transistors, and scaled down to approximately 20 angstroms, the same
<br>   gate oxide thickness required for high-performance transistors. The
<br>   overall equivalent oxide thickness in metal-oxide-semiconductor
<br>   capacitors is equivalent to an effective SiO2 thickness of approximately
<br>   6.5 angstroms. Such a low effective oxide thickness and the resulting
<br>   large capacitance cannot be achieved in conventional HfO2-based
<br>   high-dielectric-constant gate stacks without scavenging the interfacial
<br>   SiO2, which has adverse effects on the electron transport and gate
<br>   leakage current'. Accordingly, our gate stacks, which do not require
<br>   such scavenging, provide substantially lower leakage current and no
<br>   mobility degradation. This work demonstrates that ultrathin ferroic
<br>   HfO2-ZrO2 multilayers, stabilized with competing
<br>   ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order in the two-nanometre-thickness
<br>   regime, provide a path towards advanced gate oxide stacks in electronic
<br>   devices beyond conventional HfO2-based high-dielectric-constant
<br>   materials.</td>

<br>   Specifically, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, element specific x-ray

<br>   and Au L-3 edges, and ferromagnetic resonance methods were used. With
<br>   increasing thickness of a Cu or Au SL directly between the FM and the Pt

<br>   between damping and PIM that depends on the SL material. The PIM
<br>   observed in the Au layer showed a complex dependence on the layer

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Amorphous boron carbide (B4C) thin films are by far the most popular
<br>   form for the neutron converting layers in the 10B-based neutron
<br>   detectors, which are a rising trend in detector technologies in response
<br>   to the increasing scarcity and price of( 3)He, the standard material for
<br>   neutron detection. The microstructure of the B4C films is closely
<br>   related to the important properties, e.g. density and adhesion, for the
<br>   converting layers, which eventually affect the detection efficiency and
<br>   the long-term stability of the detectors. To study the influence from
<br>   substrates of different roughness and materials, the B4C films were
<br>   deposited on polished Si substrates with Al, Ti, and Cu buffer layers
<br>   and unpolished Si, Al, Ti, and Cu substrates by direct current magnetron
<br>   sputtering at a substrate temperature of 623 K. The tapered columnar
<br>   grains and nodular defects, generally observed in SEM images, indicated
<br>   a strong shadowing effect where voids were introduced around the grains.
<br>   The change in the grain size did not show a direct dependence to the
<br>   substrate roughness, acquired from the surface profile, nor to the mass
<br>   density of the films, obtained from reflectivity patterns. However,
<br>   films with non-uniform size of columnar grains were deposited on
<br>   substrates with high skewness, leading to a drop of mass density
<br>   from-95% down to-70% of tabulated bulk density. On the other hand,
<br>   similar microstructures and mass density were obtained from the films
<br>   deposited on Al, Ti, and Cu of different roughness and good adhesion
<br>   were observed from cross-cut adhesion tests, showing the reliability of
<br>   sputtering deposited B4C films on common structural materials in neutron
<br>   detectors.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Combinatorial synthesis via a continuous composition spread is an
<br>   excellent route to develop thin-film libraries as it is both time- and
<br>   cost-efficient. Creating libraries of functional, multicomponent,
<br>   complex oxide films requires excellent control over the synthesis
<br>   parameters combined with high-throughput analytical feedback. A
<br>   reliable, high-throughput, in-situ characterization analysis method is
<br>   required to meet the crucial need to rapidly screen materials libraries.
<br>   Here, we report on the combination of two in-situ techniques-(a)
<br>   Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) for heteroepitaxial
<br>   characterization and a newly developed compositional analysis technique,
<br>   low-angle x-ray spectroscopy (LAXS), to map the chemical composition
<br>   profile of combinatorial heteroepitaxial complex oxide films deposited
<br>   using a continuous composition spread method via pulsed laser
<br>   deposition. This is accomplished using a unique state-of-the-art
<br>   combinatorial growth system with a fully synchronized four-axis
<br>   mechanical substrate stage without shadow masks, alternating acquisition
<br>   of chemical compositional data using LAXS at various different positions
<br>   on the similar to 41 mm x 41mm range and sequential deposition of

<br>   (RBS) is used to calibrate and validate the compositions determined by
<br>   LAXS. This study shows the feasibility of combinatorial synthesis of
<br>   heteroepitaxial, functional complex oxide films at wafer-scale via two
<br>   essential in-situ characterization tools-RHEED for structural analysis
<br>   or heteroepitaxy and LAXS for compositional characterization. This is a

<br>   sequentially polymerize first anionic (deuterated methacrylic acid
<br>   (dMAA)) and thereafter cationic (2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA))
<br>   monomers to investigate the SI-PGP grafting process. Dry films were
<br>   investigated by ellipsometry, X-ray, and neutron reflectometry, and
<br>   their swelling was followed over a pH range from 4.5 to 10.5 with
<br>   spectroscopic ellipsometry. The deuterated monomer allows us to separate
<br>   the distributions of the two components by neutron reflectometry. Growth
<br>   of both polymers proceeds via grafting of solution-polymerized fragments
<br>   to the surface, and also the second layer is primarily grafted to the
<br>   substrate and not as a continuation of the existing chains. The polymer
<br>   films are stratified, with one layer of near 1:1 composition and the
<br>   other layer enriched in one component and located either above or below
<br>   the former layer. The ellipsometry results show swelling transitions at
<br>   low and high pH but with no systematic variation in the pH values where
<br>   these transitions occur. The results suggest that grafting density in
<br>   SI-PGP-prepared homopolymers could be increased via repeated

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and indispensable for modern
<br>   science and technology, but it is notoriously difficult to change the
<br>   magnetic order of a material in a rapid way. However, if a thin nickel
<br>   film is subjected to ultrashort laser pulses, it loses its magnetic
<br>   order almost completely within femtosecond timescales(1). This
<br>   phenomenon is widespread(2-7) and offers opportunities for rapid
<br>   information processing(8-11) or ultrafast spintronics at frequencies
<br>   approaching those of light(8,9,12). Consequently, the physics of
<br>   ultrafast demagnetization is central to modern materials
<br>   research(1-7,13-28), but a crucial question has remained elusive: if a
<br>   material loses its magnetization within mere femtoseconds, where is the
<br>   missing angular momentum in such a short time? Here we use ultrafast
<br>   electron diffraction to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous,
<br>   long-lasting, non-equilibrium population of anisotropic high-frequency
<br>   phonons that appear within 150-750 fs. The anisotropy plane is
<br>   perpendicular to the direction of the initial magnetization and the
<br>   atomic oscillation amplitude is 2 pm. We explain these observations by
<br>   means of circularly polarized phonons that quickly absorb the angular
<br>   momentum of the spin system before macroscopic sample rotation. The time
<br>   that is needed for demagnetization is related to the time it takes to
<br>   accelerate the atoms. These results provide an atomistic picture of the
<br>   Einstein-de Haas effect and signify the general importance of polarized
<br>   phonons for non-equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Vapor phase infiltration into a self-assembled block copolymer (BCP) to
<br>   create a hybrid material in one of the constituent blocks can enhance
<br>   the etch selectivity for pattern transfer. Multiple pulse infiltration
<br>   into carbohydrate-based high-chi BCP has previously been shown to enable
<br>   sub-10 nm feature pattern transfer. By optimizing the amount of
<br>   infiltrated material, the etch selectivity should be further improved.
<br>   Here, an investigation of semi-static sequential infiltration synthesis
<br>   of trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and water into maltoheptaose (MH) films, and
<br>   into hydroxyl-terminated poly(styrene) (PS-OH) films, was performed, by
<br>   varying the process parameters temperature, precursor pulse duration,
<br>   and precursor exposure length. It was found that, by decreasing the
<br>   exposure time from 100 to 20 s, the volumetric percentage on included
<br>   pure Al2O3 in MH could be increased from 2 to 40 vol% at the expense of
<br>   a decreased infiltration depth. Furthermore, the degree of infiltration
<br>   was minimally affected by temperature between 64 and 100 degrees C.
<br>   Shorter precursor pulse durations of 10 ms TMA and 5 ms water, as well
<br>   as longer precursor pulses of 75 ms TMA and 45 ms water, were both shown
<br>   to promote a higher degree, 40 vol%, of infiltrated alumina in MH. As
<br>   proof of concept, 12 nm pitch pattern transfer into silicon was
<br>   demonstrated using the method and can be concluded to be one of few
<br>   studies showing pattern transfer at such small pitch. These results are
<br>   expected to be of use for further understanding of the mechanisms
<br>   involved in sequential infiltration synthesis of TMA/water into MH, and
<br>   for further optimization of carbohydrate-based etch masks for sub-10 nm
<br>   pattern transfer. Enabling techniques for high aspect ratio pattern
<br>   transfer at the single nanometer scale could be of high interest, e.g.,
<br>   in the high-end transistor industry.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Amorphous, ferrimagnetic Tb-Co thin films prepared with a thin Ta
<br>   underlayer and either a Ta or a Pt overlayer show evidence of both soft
<br>   and hard magnetic phases. At room temperature, the films exhibit
<br>   conventional ferromagnetism, but low temperature magnetometry
<br>   measurements reveal the decoupling of the two magnetic phases with
<br>   decreasing temperature due to increased anisotropy energy of the hard
<br>   layer at lower temperatures. Decreasing the film thickness to 2nm,
<br>   slightly above the superparamagnetic limit found at 1nm, a soft,
<br>   low-density phase was isolated and found to be present in all the films
<br>   as confirmed with x-ray reflectivity and Rutherford backscattering
<br>   spectrometry measurements. For greater thicknesses, the bottom layer
<br>   retains its soft magnetic nature, while the remainder of the film is
<br>   denser and has strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, leading to the
<br>   exchange-spring behavior when the anisotropy becomes large, either at
<br>   low temperatures or via a Pt overlayer that adds a strong interfacial
<br>   anisotropy to the layer. Micromagnetic simulations of a soft/hard
<br>   bilayer model with the experimentally determined anisotropy and
<br>   magnetization parameters into a soft/hard bilayer model reproduced the
<br>   experimental hysteretic behavior very well. These findings demonstrate
<br>   how the magnetic state and the response of a-Tb-Co films to external
<br>   fields can be controlled, providing a high degree of tunability that is
<br>   promising for high-performance nanoscale devices. Published under an

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Heterointerfaces have led to the discovery of novel electronic and
<br>   magnetic states because of their strongly entangled electronic degrees
<br>   of freedom. Single-phase chromium compounds always exhibit
<br>   antiferromagnetism following the prediction of the Goodenough-Kanamori
<br>   rules. So far, exchange coupling between chromium ions via heteroanions
<br>   has not been explored and the associated quantum states are unknown.
<br>   Here, we report the successful epitaxial synthesis and characterization
<br>   of chromium oxide (Cr2O3)-chromium nitride (CrN) superlattices.
<br>   Room-temperature ferromagnetic spin ordering is achieved at the
<br>   interfaces between these two antiferromagnets, and the magnitude of the
<br>   effect decays with increasing layer thickness. First-principles
<br>   calculations indicate that robust ferromagnetic spin interaction between
<br>   Cr3+ ions via anion-hybridization across the interface yields the lowest
<br>   total energy. This work opens the door to fundamental understanding of
<br>   the unexpected and exceptional properties of oxide-nitride interfaces
<br>   and provides access to hidden phases at low-dimensional quantum

<br>   first-order metamagnetic phase transition between antiferromagnetic and
<br>   ferromagnetic order in the vicinity of room temperature, exhibiting
<br>   interconnected structural, magnetic, and electronic order parameters. We
<br>   show that these two alloys can be combined to form hybrid metamagnets in
<br>   the form of sputter-deposited superlattices and alloys on
<br>   single-crystalline MgO substrates. Despite being structurally different,
<br>   the magnetic behavior of the alloys with substantial Mn content
<br>   resembles that of the FeRh/MnRh superlattices in the ultrathin
<br>   individual layer limit. For FeRh/MnRh superlattices, dissimilar lattice
<br>   distortions of the constituent FeRh and MnRh layers at the
<br>   antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic transition cause double-step transitions
<br>   during cooling, while the magnetization during the heating branch shows
<br>   a smooth, continuous trend. For Fe(50-x)Mn(x)Rh(50 )alloy films, the
<br>   substitution of Mn at the Fe sites introduces an effective tensile
<br>   in-plane strain and magnetic frustration in the highly ordered epitaxial
<br>   films, largely influencing the phase transition temperature T-M (by more

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: While the atomic structure of interfaces in complex oxide
<br>   heterostructures created by epitaxial growth has been investigated
<br>   extensively, few studies have been conducted on how interfaces form and
<br>   restructure at the initial stage of film growth. The dynamic aspects of
<br>   the growth behavior can strongly influence the final interfacial atomic
<br>   structure, which may lead to the emergence of interface-specific
<br>   properties, such as the rise of interfacial superconductivity between
<br>   certain Ruddlesden-Popper oxide materials. Here, the structural
<br>   development of La2CuO4 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a
<br>   LaSrAlO4 substrate is investigated by X-ray diffraction measurements
<br>   with rapid scans over a volume of reciprocal space. This method provides
<br>   far more detailed information on interface formation than traditional
<br>   fixed-point measurements. The results show that the atomic structure of
<br>   the interface becomes fully established after just a single unit cell of
<br>   growth. Interestingly, restructuring continues to occur within the
<br>   topmost half to one unit cell of the film during the deposition process.
<br>   However, diffraction intensity oscillations from both reflection
<br>   high-energy electron and X-ray measurements stabilize only after the
<br>   growth of two unit cells, indicating that the growth front morphology
<br>   continues to evolve until the start of the third unit cell. This
<br>   multimodal investigation provides insights into the atomic processes
<br>   taking place during layered oxide interface formation, including the
<br>   dynamical rearrangement of LaO and CuO2 layers. Such information is not
<br>   only relevant to the engineering and optimization of functional layer
<br>   structures but can also be critical for ultrathin films.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The central unit in an integrated memory device is a magnetic tunnel
<br>   junction (MTJ) consisting of two ferromagnetic layers, often using
<br>   complex alloys such as CoFeB, separated by an insulating barrier such as
<br>   MgO. Atomic level precision is required to fabricate miniaturized
<br>   devices, and atomic layer etching (ALE) is one of the most promising
<br>   methods to do this. However, at the nanoscale, it is imperative to
<br>   maintain the concentration of each element in an alloy during etching,
<br>   and it is important to not affect the insulating barrier, i.e. the
<br>   etching process should stop at MgO. Here we use thermal dry etching of
<br>   CoFeB alloy thin films with sequential doses of chlorine and
<br>   2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone, acacH). Patterned samples are modified
<br>   with atomic level precision, and the process is completely selective to
<br>   the removal of CoFeB alloy in ALE regime without changing the alloy
<br>   composition and without etching MgO that is used as a protecting layer.
<br>   The etching process was investigated by comparing the film thickness on
<br>   a patterned surface before and after ALE process using atomic force
<br>   microscopy (AFM). The viable key features of the reaction mechanism were
<br>   proposed by detection of key desorbing fragments during a heating ramp
<br>   via temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Ex-situ X-ray
<br>   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to characterize the

<br>   Towards understanding and controlling the kinetics of oxygen transport

<br>   underlying lattice dynamics and ionic activities related to oxygen
<br>   variation. In this study, the evolution of oxygen content is identified
<br>   in real-time during the progress of a topotactic phase transition in
<br>   La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta epitaxial thin films, both at the surface and
<br>   throughout the bulk. Using polarized neutron reflectometry, a

<br>   microscopy, uniquely reveals the formation of a novel structural phase
<br>   near the surface. Surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopies further confirm
<br>   a significant change of the electronic structure accompanying the
<br>   transition. The anisotropic features of this novel phase enable a
<br>   distinct oxygen diffusion pathway in contrast to conventional
<br>   observation of oxygen motion at moderate temperatures. The results

<br>   An amorphous SrTiO3 layer on a Si:B/Si1-xGex:B heterostructure is
<br>   reconfigured at the atomic scale upon heating, exhibiting a change in
<br>   volume of approximate to 2% and accompanying biaxial stress. The

<br>   followed by sputter deposition of SrTiO3 at room temperature. The
<br>   processes yield a hybrid oxide/semiconductor nanomembrane. Upon release
<br>   from the substrate, the nanomembrane rolls up and has a curvature
<br>   determined by the stress in the epitaxially grown Si:B/Si1-xGex:B
<br>   heterostructure. Heating to 600 degrees C leads to a decrease of the

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Catalyzing capping layers on metal hydrides are employed to enhance the
<br>   hydrogenation kinetics of metal hydride-based systems such as hydrogen
<br>   sensors. Here, we use a novel experimental method to study the
<br>   hydrogenation kinetics of catalyzing capping layers composed of several
<br>   alloys of Pd and Au as well as Pt, Ni, and Ru, all with and without an
<br>   additional PTFE polymer protection layer and under the same set of
<br>   experimental conditions. In particular, we employ a thin Ta film as an
<br>   optical indicator to study the kinetics of the catalytic layers
<br>   deposited on top of it and which allows one to determine the absolute
<br>   hydrogenation rates. Our results demonstrate that doping Pd with Au
<br>   results in significantly faster hydrogenation kinetics, with response
<br>   times up to five times shorter than Pd through enhanced diffusion and a
<br>   reduction in the activation energy. On the other hand, the kinetics of
<br>   non-Pd-based materials turn out to be significantly slower and mainly
<br>   limited by the diffusion through the capping layer itself. Surprisingly,
<br>   the additional PTFE layer was only found to improve the kinetics of
<br>   Pd-based capping materials and has no significant effect on the kinetics
<br>   of Pt, Ni, and Ru. Taken together, the experimental results aid in
<br>   rationally choosing a suitable capping material for the application of
<br>   metal hydrides and other materials in a hydrogen economy. In addition,
<br>   the used method can be applied to simultaneously study the hydrogenation
<br>   kinetics in thin-film materials for a wide set of experimental
<br>   conditions.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
<br>   (PMA) have recently attracted intensive attention for their potential
<br>   applications in domain-wall-based racetrack memory. In this paper, swift
<br>   heavy Fe ion irradiation is introduced to tune the magnetic properties
<br>   of Pt/Co/Pt/Ru/Pt/Co/Ta SAFs from spin-flip to spin-flop transition. The
<br>   evolutions of magnetic domain and domain wall motion are investigated to
<br>   obtain the microscopic insight into the change of magnetic states. Both
<br>   the experimental and the simulated results demonstrate that different
<br>   responses of the effective PMA constant and the
<br>   interlayer-exchange-coupling strength to ion irradiation determine the
<br>   magnetic-phase transitions. The structure evolution from experiments and
<br>   theoretical simulations suggests that the ion-irradiation-induced damage
<br>   mainly happens at the Pt/Co interface. The damage leads to the different
<br>   decrease rates of the effective PMA constant and the
<br>   interlayerexchange-coupling strength due to their intrinsic direct and
<br>   Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction nature, respectively. A quite
<br>   good thermal stability of samples is obtained with ion fluence <1.5
<br>   x10(14) ions/cm(2). In this paper, we demonstrate that ion irradiation
<br>   is a promising method to tailor magnetic properties of SAFs.

<br>   switchable electric polarization, which offers significant promise for
<br>   nonvolatile memories. In particular, ferroelectric tunnel junctions
<br>   (FTJs) have emerged as a new resistive switching memory which exploits
<br>   polarization-dependent tunnel current across a thin ferroelectric
<br>   barrier. This work integrates FTJs with complementary
<br>   metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible Zr-doped HfO2 (Zr:HfO2)
<br>   ferroelectric barriers of just 1 nm thickness, grown by atomic layer
<br>   deposition on silicon. These 1 nm Zr:HfO2 tunnel junctions exhibit large
<br>   polarization-driven electroresistance (>20 000%), the largest value

<br>   ferroelectric barrier, these junctions provide large tunneling current
<br>   (>1 A cm(-2)) at low read voltage, orders of magnitude larger than
<br>   reported thicker HfO2-based FTJs. Therefore, this proof-of-principle
<br>   demonstration provides an approach to simultaneously overcome three

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Complex oxides provide rich physics related to ionic defects. For the
<br>   proper tuning of functionalities in oxide heterostructures, it is highly
<br>   desired to develop fast, effective, and low-temperature routes for the
<br>   dynamic modification of defect concentration and distribution. Herein,
<br>   the use of helium implantation to efficiently control the vacancy
<br>   profiles in epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta thin films is reported. The
<br>   viability of this approach is supported by lattice expansion in the
<br>   out-of-plane lattice direction and dramatic change in physical
<br>   properties, i.e., a transition from ferromagnetic metallic to
<br>   antiferromagnetic insulating. In particular, a significant increase of
<br>   resistivity up to four orders of magnitude is evidenced at room
<br>   temperature, upon implantation of highly energetic He ions. The result
<br>   offers an attractive means for tuning the emergent physical properties
<br>   of oxide thin films via strong coupling between strain, defects, and

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The recent discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate
<br>   films has aroused great interest since it provides a new platform to
<br>   explore the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. However,
<br>   superconductivity only appears in the thin film form and synthesizing
<br>   superconducting nickelate films is extremely challenging, limiting the
<br>   in-depth studies on this compound. Here, we explore the critical
<br>   parameters in the growth of high-quality nickelate films using molecular
<br>   beam epitaxy. We found that stoichiometry is crucial in optimizing the
<br>   crystalline structure and realizing superconductivity in nickelate
<br>   films. In precursor NdNiO3 films, optimal stoichiometry of cations
<br>   yields the most compact lattice while off-stoichiometry of cations
<br>   causes obvious lattice expansion, influencing the subsequent topotactic
<br>   reduction and the emergence of superconductivity in infinite-layer
<br>   nickelates. Surprisingly, in-situ reflection high energy electron
<br>   diffraction indicates that some impurity phases always appear once Sr
<br>   ions are doped into NdNiO3 although the X-ray diffraction data are of
<br>   high quality. While these impurity phases do not seem to suppress the
<br>   superconductivity, their impacts on the electronic and magnetic
<br>   structure deserve further studies. Our work demonstrates and highlights
<br>   the significance of cation stoichiometry in the superconducting

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Titania nanotube arrays with their enormous surface area are the subject
<br>   of much attention in diverse fields of research. In the present work, we
<br>   show that not only 60 keV and 150 keV ion bombardment of amorphous
<br>   titania nanotube arrays yields defect creation within the tube walls,
<br>   but it also changes the surface morphology: the surface relaxes and
<br>   smoothens in accordance with a curvature-driven surface material's
<br>   transport mechanism, which is mediated by radiation-induced viscous flow
<br>   or radiation-enhanced surface diffusion, while the nanotubes act as
<br>   additional sinks for the particle surface currents. These effects occur
<br>   independently of the ion species: both carbon and neon ion bombardments
<br>   result in comparable surface relaxation responses initiated by an ion
<br>   energy of 60 keV at a fluence of 1 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). Using atomic
<br>   force microscopy and contact angle measurements, we thoroughly study the
<br>   relaxation effects on the surface topography and surface free energy,
<br>   respectively. Moreover, surface relaxation is accompanied by further
<br>   amorphization in surface-near regions and a reduction in the mass
<br>   density, as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray reflectivity.
<br>   Since ion bombardment can be performed on global and local scales, it
<br>   constitutes a versatile tool to achieve well-defined and tunable
<br>   topographies and distinct surface characteristics. Hence, different
<br>   types of nanotube arrays can be modified for various applications.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful tool for probing thin films at
<br>   length scales down to nanometers. We investigated the use of a neural
<br>   network to predict a two-layer thin film structure to model a given
<br>   measured reflectivity curve. Application of this neural network to
<br>   predict a thin film structure revealed that it was accurate and could
<br>   provide an excellent starting point for traditional fitting methods.
<br>   Employing prediction-guided fitting has considerable potential for more
<br>   rapidly producing a result compared to the labor-intensive but
<br>   commonly-used approach of trial and error searches prior to refinement.
<br>   A deeper look at the stability of the predictive power of the neural
<br>   network against statistical fluctuations of measured reflectivity
<br>   profiles showed that the predictions are stable. We conclude that the
<br>   approach presented here can provide valuable assistance to users of NR
<br>   and should be further extended for use in studies of more complex
<br>   n-layer thin film systems. This result also opens up the possibility of

<br>   (FMR). Effective magnetic moment of the samples, as observed from PNR
<br>   decreases with increasing Ta concentration and increases with increasing

<br>   real-time decisions about measurement angle, measurement time, contrast
<br>   choice and other experimental conditions based on parameters of

<br>   uncertainties, and these are shown to decrease with the square root of
<br>   the measurement time, providing useful information for the planning and

<br>   signalling that an experiment needs to continue. The approach's

<br>   application as a mirror or monochromator in the ``water window'' soft
<br>   X-ray spectral regime. Two sets of Cr/Ti multilayers at moderate and low
<br>   bi-layer thickness regime have been prepared for this purpose using Ion
<br>   Beam Sputtering technique. In one set, Cr/Ti multilayer with 25, 50, 60
<br>   and 100 numbers of bilayers with moderate bi-layer thickness of 3.8 nm
<br>   have been deposited. In another set, four samples each having low
<br>   bilayer thickness of 2.4 nm with 25, 50, 75 and 100 number of bi-layers
<br>   have been prepared and the multilayers have subsequently been
<br>   characterized with Specular X-ray reflectivity and diffuse X-ray
<br>   scattering measurements at grazing incidence with hard X-rays. It is
<br>   observed that cumulative effect of interface imperfections became more
<br>   pronounced with increasing number of bilayers resulting in continuous
<br>   increase in the interface width in both the thickness regimes; however,
<br>   its evolution is not exactly same for the two sets of samples. Diffuse
<br>   X-ray scattering result reveals that for the first set of samples,
<br>   interface imperfections are dominated by interface roughness with no
<br>   change in the interface diffusion with increase in number of layers,
<br>   while for the second set, both interface roughness as well as interface
<br>   diffusion contribute towards the cumulative accumulation of interface
<br>   imperfections which is also confirmed by cross-sectional Transmission
<br>   Electron Microscopy. Finally, performance of the multilayers in water
<br>   window regime has been checked by soft X-ray reflectivity measurements
<br>   using synchrotron radiation. The above results have direct implication

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Synthetic ferromagnets (SFMs) possess the same layer structure found in
<br>   the widely studied synthetic antiferromagnets. This consists of two
<br>   ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by a nonmagnetic (NM) spacer forming
<br>   the structure FM1/NM/FM2, but SFMs describe the case where the
<br>   interlayer exchange coupling promotes the parallel alignment of the
<br>   magnetizations of the FM layers. The frequency and phase of the dynamic
<br>   response of these structures depends sensitively on the interlayer
<br>   exchange coupling as well as on the individual layer magnetizations.
<br>   Through experiments and numerical simulations, we show that the dynamic
<br>   response of the two ferromagnetic layers has an orthogonal dependence on
<br>   the difference in layer magnetization and interlayer coupling allowing
<br>   both parameters to be determined accurately. In addition, we are able to
<br>   obtain the phases of the resonant modes, a hitherto challenging
<br>   measurement, and thus show that the conventional acoustic and optical
<br>   description does not fully capture the intricacies of SFM dynamics.
<br>   These findings are directly applicable to the creation of tailored SFMs

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Topotactic transformations involve structural changes between related
<br>   crystal structures due to a loss or gain of material while retaining a
<br>   crystallographic relationship. The perovskite oxide La0.7Sr0.3CoO3
<br>   (LSCO) is an ideal system for investigating phase transformations due to
<br>   its high oxygen vacancy conductivity, relatively low oxygen vacancy
<br>   formation energy, and strong coupling of the magnetic and electronic
<br>   properties to the oxygen stoichiometry. While the transition between
<br>   cobaltite perovskite and brownmillerite (BM) phases has been widely
<br>   reported, further reduction beyond the BM phase lacks systematic
<br>   studies. In this paper, we study the evolution of the physical
<br>   properties of LSCO thin films upon exposure to highly reducing
<br>   environments. We observe the rarely reported crystalline
<br>   Ruddlesden-Popper phase, which involves the loss of both oxygen anions
<br>   and cobalt cations upon annealing where the cobalt is found as isolated
<br>   Co ions or Co nanoparticles. First-principles calculations confirm that
<br>   the concurrent loss of oxygen and cobalt ions is thermodynamically
<br>   possible through an intermediary BM phase. The strong correlation of the
<br>   magnetic and electronic properties to the crystal structure highlights
<br>   the potential of utilizing ion migration as a basis for emerging
<br>   applications such as neuromorphic computing.</td>

<br>   manganite Gd1-x Ca (x) MnO3 (GCMO) thin film with x = 0.4 was
<br>   investigated. Based on the magnetic measurements, the AFM-FM coupling is
<br>   suppressed by the vacuum annealing treatment via destroying the double
<br>   exchange interaction and increasing the unit cell volume by converting
<br>   the Mn4+ to the Mn3+. Consequently, resistance increases significantly
<br>   compared to pristine film. The results are explained by a model obtained
<br>   from the positron annihilation studies, where the vacuum annealing
<br>   increased the annihilation lifetime in A and B sites due to the
<br>   formation of vacancy complexes V (A,B)-V-O, which was not the case in
<br>   the pristine sample. The positron annihilation analysis indicated that
<br>   most of the open volume defects have been detected in the interface
<br>   region rather than on the subsurface layer and this result is confirmed
<br>   by detailed x-ray reflection analysis. On the other hand, the effect of
<br>   oxygen annealing on the unit cell volume and magnetization was
<br>   insignificant. This is in agreement with positron annihilation results
<br>   which demonstrated that the introduction of oxygen does not change the
<br>   number of cation vacancies significantly. This work demonstrates that
<br>   the modification of oxygen vacancies and vacancy complexes can tune
<br>   magnetic and electronic structure of the epitaxial thin films to provide

<br>   control via ferroelectric polarization, advantageous for the
<br>   low-dissipation spintronics. Modern understanding of the magnetoelectric
<br>   coupling in these systems involves structural, orbital, and magnetic
<br>   reconstructions at interfaces. Previous works have long proposed
<br>   polarization-dependent interfacial magnetic structures; however, direct
<br>   evidence is still missing, which requires advanced characterization
<br>   tools with near-atomic-scale spatial resolutions. Here, extensive
<br>   polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) studies have determined the
<br>   magnetic depth profiles of PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3/La(0.6)7Sr(0.33)MnO(3)
<br>   (PZT/LSMO) bilayers with opposite self-polarizations. When the LSMO is
<br>   2-3 nm thick, the bilayers show two magnetic transitions on cooling.
<br>   However, temperature-dependent magnetization is different below the
<br>   lower-temperature transition for opposite polarizations. PNR finds that
<br>   the LSMO splits into two magnetic sublayers, but the inter-sublayer
<br>   magnetic couplings are of opposite signs for the two polarizations.
<br>   Near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy further shows contrasts in both

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The choice of electrostatic gating over the conventional chemical doping
<br>   for phase engineering of quantum materials is attributed to the fact
<br>   that the former can reversibly tune the carrier density without
<br>   affecting the system?s level of disorder. However, this proposition
<br>   seems to break down in field-effect transistors involving SrTiO3
<br>   (STO)-based two-dimensional electron gases. Such peculiar behavior is
<br>   associated with electron trapping under an external electric field.
<br>   However, the microscopic nature of the trapping centers remains an open
<br>   question. In this paper, we investigate electric-field-induced
<br>   chargetrapping and charge-detrapping phenomena at the conducting
<br>   interface between the band insulators ? -Al2O3 and STO. Our transport
<br>   measurements reveal that the charge trapping under a positive back-gate
<br>   voltage (Vg) above the tetragonal-to-cubic structural transition
<br>   temperature (Tc) of STO has a contribution from electric-field-assisted
<br>   thermal escape of electrons from the quantum well, and from clustering
<br>   of oxygen vacancies as well. We observe an additional source of trapping
<br>   below Tc, which arises from the trapping of free carriers at
<br>   ferroelastic twin walls in the STO. Application of a negative Vg results
<br>   in charge detrapping, which vanishes above Tc. This feature demonstrates
<br>   the crucial role of structural domain walls in the electrical transport
<br>   properties of STO-based heterostructures. The number of charges trapped
<br>   (detrapped) at (from) a twin wall is controlled by the net polarity of
<br>   the wall and is completely reversible with a sweep of Vg.</td>

<br>   Here a new strategy to include nanoparticles (NPs) without any ligand
<br>   termination inside PEDOT:PSS thin films is proposed. Spark
<br>   discharge-generated tin oxide NPs (SnOx-NPs) are ``gently'' and
<br>   homogenously deposited through low-energy diffusion mode. Strong

<br>   Seebeck coefficient enhancement. The optimized power factor of 116 mu
<br>   Wm(-1) K-2 achieved is more than six times higher than the value found

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In this work, we demonstrate an approach for improving ferroelectric
<br>   properties of La:HfO2 thin films by shifting the grain growth regime
<br>   toward heterogeneous nucleation. A dilute 0.083 M instead of a 0.25 M
<br>   solution together with an annealing step after every spin-coating cycle
<br>   film gives rise to a significant improvement of ferroelectric
<br>   properties. While a remanent polarization of 7 mu C/cm(2) was found for
<br>   randomly oriented conventional films, the value of 15 mu C/cm(2) for the
<br>   dilute solution is a result of a mixed 111 and 002 preferential
<br>   orientation. A more than 50% improved breakdown voltage stems from a
<br>   global density improvement from 8.0 to 8.4g/cm(3) as obtained from x-ray
<br>   reflectivity (XRR). We also find superstructure peaks in XRR hinting on
<br>   periodic alternations of the local density throughout the film
<br>   thickness. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion
<br>   mass spectrometry confirm this periodicity. The sensitivity of XRR for
<br>   this periodicity was leveraged to gain further insights in the origin of
<br>   this superstructure with additional experiments. We conclude that both
<br>   orientation and the superstructure are caused by a ``layered
<br>   structure'' according to Schuler's microstructural zone model.
<br>   However, our data also provide evidence for parallel chemical effects of
<br>   cap formation in each stacked sub-layer. While this work shows a
<br>   significant enhancement of ferroelectric properties, it also provides
<br>   insights into further optimization potential of solution deposition of
<br>   HfO2/ZrO2 thin films. Our XRR-based approach supplemented with suitable
<br>   additional analysis can be of great value for the optimization of other
<br>   solution-derived thin films beyond the material class studied here.</td>

<br>   being largest in 0.1 M KOH compared to LiOH and NaOH. Using crystal
<br>   truncation rod analysis, -O is detected on the coordinatively

<br>   molecules (four H-bonds) decreases from Li+ to K+ at OER potentials. The
<br>   higher activity of more isolated interfacial OH - ions in the case of K+
<br>   and the lesser stabilization of -O intermediates by hydration water of
<br>   K+ compared to Na+ and Li+ can result in higher OER activity for KOH.

<br>   to engineer the spin properties of the molecule and has potential

<br>   investigate a superconductor/molecule/normal metal heterostructure and
<br>   demonstrate spin-ordering and proximity induced superconducting
<br>   properties at the metallo-molecular interface.
<br>   Combining magnetic and superconducting functionalities enables lower
<br>   energy spin transfer and magnetic switching in quantum computing and
<br>   information storage, owing to the dissipationless nature of
<br>   quasi-particle mediated supercurrents. Here, we put forward a system
<br>   where emergent spin-ordering and diffusion of Cooper pairs are achieved
<br>   at a non-intrinsically magnetic nor superconducting metallo-molecular
<br>   interface. Electron transport, magnetometry and low-energy muon spin
<br>   rotation are used to probe time-reversal symmetry breaking in these
<br>   structures. By comparing the Meissner expulsion in a system including a
<br>   Cu/C-60 spin-converter interface to one without, we observe a
<br>   paramagnetic contribution that can be explained due to the conversion of
<br>   spin-singlet Cooper pair states into odd-frequency triplet states. These
<br>   results demonstrate the potential of metallo-molecular interfaces to
<br>   achieve singlet to triplet Cooper pair conversion, a capability not
<br>   present in either metal or molecule separately that could be used in the
<br>   generation and controlled diffusion of spin polarised dissipationless

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Blended organic thin films have been studied during the last decades due
<br>   to their applicability in organic solar cells. Although their optical
<br>   and electronic features have been examined intensively, there is still a
<br>   lack of detailed knowledge about their growth processes and resulting
<br>   morphologies, which play a key role in the efficiency of optoelectronic
<br>   devices such as organic solar cells. In this study, pure and blended
<br>   thin films of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and the Buckminster fullerene
<br>   (C-60) were grown by vacuum deposition onto a native silicon oxide
<br>   substrate at two different substrate temperatures, 310 and 400 K. The
<br>   evolution of roughness was followed by in situ real-time x-ray
<br>   reflectivity. Crystal orientation, island densities, and morphology were
<br>   examined after the growth by x-ray diffraction experiments and
<br>   microscopy techniques. The formation of a smooth wetting layer followed
<br>   by rapid roughening was found in pure CuPc thin films, whereas C-60
<br>   shows a fast formation of distinct islands at a very early stage of
<br>   growth. The growth of needlelike CuPc crystals losing their alignment
<br>   with the substrate was identified in co-deposited thin films.
<br>   Furthermore, the data demonstrate that structural features become larger
<br>   and more pronounced and that the island density decreases by a factor of
<br>   four when going from 310 to 400 K. Finally, the key parameters roughness
<br>   and island density were well reproduced on a smaller scale by kinetic
<br>   Monte Carlo simulations of a generic, binary lattice model with simple
<br>   nearest-neighbor interaction energies. A weak molecule-substrate
<br>   interaction caused a fast island formation and weak interaction between
<br>   molecules of different species was able to reproduce the observed phase
<br>   separation. The introduction of different same-species and cross-species
<br>   Ehrlich-Schwoebel barriers for interlayer hopping was necessary to
<br>   reproduce the roughness evolution in the blend and showed the growth of
<br>   CuPc crystals on top of the thin film in agreement with the experiment.</td>

<br>   (Platinum) as a buffer, an ultrathin ferromagnet (Cobalt) as a
<br>   functional layer, and an antiferromagnetic insulator (Nickel oxide,
<br>   NixOy) as a capping, is a host of intriguing physical phenomena
<br>   desirable for spintronics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed
<br>   changes in the ratio of NixOy phases with different stoichiometry. Due
<br>   to strong spin-orbit coupling, the Pt layer induces perpendicular
<br>   magnetic anisotropy in Co, breaks its structural inversion symmetry, and
<br>   causes an additive effect of Pt/Co and Co/NixOy interfaces to the
<br>   effective interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-eff).
<br>   Manipulation the magnetic anisotropy can be realized by the
<br>   ferromagnetic layer thickness variation and modification of the Co/NixOy
<br>   interface. The NixOy capping layer induces the exchange bias in Co,
<br>   which effective field vertical bar Beb vertical bar can be controlled in
<br>   the range from 0 to 24 mT. The magnitude and direction of B-eb does not
<br>   affect D-eff. The increase of Ar pressure leads to structural
<br>   transformation of the Co/NixOy interface and, consequently, to decrease
<br>   of the surface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-s), the source of
<br>   which is the NiO phase. We demonstrate that the studied Pt/Co/NixOy
<br>   system has a number of functional properties useful for future logic and

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Current induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in heavy metals with strong
<br>   spin-orbit coupling strength has attracted considerable attention due to
<br>   its potential applications in spintronic technology. Pt, as one of the
<br>   mostly used heavy metals in SOT-based spintronic devices, shows large
<br>   spin Hall angle (hSH) with its single phase and alloy counterparts. In
<br>   this work, the in-plane crystallographic orientations related hSH of
<br>   epitaxial Pt(111) layer is reported in MgO(111)/Pt(111)/Co/Ta
<br>   heterostructures with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The hSH
<br>   shows a quite large difference with values, respectively, around 0.083
<br>   and 0.057 when the current applied along the 1/2 110 similar to and 1/2
<br>   112 similar to crystallographic directions of Pt(111) by the
<br>   damping-like SOT efficiency using the harmonic Hall voltage measurement
<br>   technique. The critical switching current densities also show large
<br>   difference between these two orthogonal crystallographic orientations
<br>   with the trend of that the larger SOT efficiency leads to the smaller
<br>   critical switching current density. It independently confirms the
<br>   generation of different dampinglike SOT efficiency when current along
<br>   1/2 110 similar to and 1/2 112 similar to directions of Pt(111).
<br>   Moreover, a perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/Ta reference
<br>   heterostructures with Pt having polycrystalline phase shows tiny
<br>   variation of damping-like SOT efficiency in in-plane two orthogonal
<br>   directions, which also indirectly indicates the crystallographic
<br>   orientations related hSH in epitaxial Pt(111) layers. This study
<br>   indicates that the hSH of epitaxial Pt is a crystallographic
<br>   orientations related parameter.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study, we address the impact of Ti underlayer thickness (UL:
<br>   0-40 nm) on the structural, magnetic, and microscopic properties of TbFe
<br>   thin films. The structural analysis confirmed the intermixing at
<br>   interfaces of the Ti and TbFe layer with the increment of UL
<br>   thicknesses. Out-of-plane (OOP) coercivity (H-c), and saturation field
<br>   (H-s) gradually increased with an increase in UL thickness. For UL = 10
<br>   nm, the domain contrast and OOP stray field strength were enhanced,
<br>   which may be due to the extent of d-d hybridization dominated over the
<br>   influence of interfacial roughness. While for UL = 20, and 40 nm, the
<br>   extent of interfacial roughness dominated the hybridization effects. In
<br>   the case of UL: 20 nm, H-c increased by nearly 6 times more than the
<br>   bare TbFe system. We observed a state with high OOP Hc combined with
<br>   nearly zero OOP stray fields that are found to coexist in the sample.
<br>   The magnetization reversal studies on a large area reveal domain
<br>   nucleation followed by domain wall motion in all the films. The idea of
<br>   tuning magnetic properties by varying thicknesses of Ti UL may be useful
<br>   in spintronics applications.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Anion ordering is a promising route to engineer physical properties in
<br>   functional heteroanionic materials. A central challenge in the study of
<br>   anion-ordered compounds lies in developing robust synthetic strategies
<br>   to control anion occupation and in understanding the resultant
<br>   implications for electronic structure. Here, we show that epitaxial
<br>   strain induces preferential occupation of F and O on the anion-sites in
<br>   perovskite oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta F gamma films grown on different
<br>   substrates. Under compressive strain, F tends to occupy the apical-like
<br>   sites, which was revealed by F and O K-edge linearly polarized X-ray
<br>   absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations,
<br>   resulting in an enhanced c-axis expansion. Under tensile strain, F tends
<br>   to occupy the equatorial-like sites, enabling the longer Mn-F bonds to
<br>   lie within the plane. The oxyfluoride films exhibit a significant
<br>   orbital polarization of the 3d electrons, distinct F-site dependence to
<br>   their valence band density of states, and an enhanced resistivity when F
<br>   occupies the apical-like anion-site compared to the equatorial-like
<br>   site. By demonstrating a general strategy for inducing preferential
<br>   anion-site occupancy in oxyfluoride perovskites, this work lays the
<br>   foundation for future materials design and synthesis efforts that
<br>   leverage this greater degree of atomic control to realize new polar or
<br>   quasi-two-dimensional materials.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Nanoscale Ru/C multilayers are essential reflective optics in the hard
<br>   x-ray region of 7-20 keV. To understand the layer growth behavior and
<br>   develop ultrathin Ru/C multilayer mirrors with periods smaller than 3.0
<br>   nm, multilayers with different periods of 6.2-1.5 nm were fabricated and
<br>   studied. It is found that the average interface width started to
<br>   increase obviously when the period became smaller than 2.5 nm while the
<br>   surface roughness of different multilayers remained almost the same. The
<br>   intrinsic stress of the multilayer gradually decreased with decreasing
<br>   period and reached a very low value of -82 MPa at d = 2.3 nm. High
<br>   reflectance of 54% and 65% (at E = 8.04 keV) were demonstrated for the
<br>   multilayers with periods of 2.5 nm and 3.0 nm, respectively, whereas
<br>   that for 1.9 nm period was significantly lower. To further analyze the
<br>   layer microstructure, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron
<br>   microscopy were used. The polycrystallized structure of Ru remained
<br>   similar for the multilayers with period less than 2.5 nm, while a
<br>   non-continuous layer growth and severe intermixing between Ru and C were
<br>   observed for the multilayer with period of 1.9 nm. The increased
<br>   intermixing between Ru and C was found to be the main reason for the
<br>   larger interface width and lower reflectance of the multilayers with
<br>   period smaller than 2.5 nm. It also indicated that the layer thickness
<br>   threshold for a Ru/C multilayer growing with good layer quality is
<br>   1.0-1.2 nm.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Multilayer X-ray mirrors consist of a coating of a large number of
<br>   alternate layers of high Z and low Z materials with a typical thickness
<br>   of 10-100 angstrom, on a suitable substrate. Such coatings play an
<br>   important role in enhancing the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors by
<br>   allowing reflections at angles much larger than the critical angle of
<br>   X-ray reflection for the given materials. Coating with an equal
<br>   thickness of each bilayer (constant period multilayers) enhances the
<br>   reflectivity at discrete energies, satisfying Bragg condition for the
<br>   given thickness. However, by systematically varying the bilayer
<br>   thickness in the multilayer stack (depth graded multilayers), it is
<br>   possible to design X-ray mirrors having enhanced reflectivity over a
<br>   broad energy range. One of the most important applications of such a
<br>   depth graded multilayer mirror is to realize hard X-ray telescopes for
<br>   astronomical purposes. Design of such multilayer X-ray mirrors and their
<br>   characterization with X-ray reflectivity measurements require
<br>   appropriate software tools that can compute X-ray reflectivity for the
<br>   given set of parameters and geometry. We have initiated the development
<br>   of hard X-ray optics for future Indian X-ray astronomical missions, and
<br>   in this context, we have developed a program, DarpanX, to calculate
<br>   X-ray reflectivity for single and multilayer mirrors. It can be used as
<br>   a stand-alone tool for designing multilayer mirrors with required
<br>   characteristics. But more importantly, it has been implemented as a
<br>   local model for the popular X-ray spectral fitting program, XSPEC, and
<br>   thus can be used for accurate fitting of the experimentally measured
<br>   X-ray reflectivity data. DarpanX is implemented as a Python 3 module,
<br>   and an API is provided to access the underlying algorithms. Here we
<br>   present details of DarpanX implementation and its validation for
<br>   different types of multilayer structures. We also demonstrate the model
<br>   fitting capability of DarpanX for experimental X-ray reflectivity
<br>   measurements of single and multilayer samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The nature of an interfacial structure buried within a device assembly
<br>   is often critical to its function. For example, the dye/TiO2 interfacial
<br>   structure that comprises the working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar
<br>   cell (DSC) governs its photovoltaic output. These structures have been
<br>   determined outside of the DSC device, using ex situ characterization
<br>   methods; yet, they really should be probed while held within a DSC since
<br>   they are modulated by the device environment. Dye/TiO2 structures will
<br>   be particularly influenced by a layer of electrolyte ions that lies
<br>   above the dye self-assembly. We show that electrolyte/dye/TiO2
<br>   interfacial structures can be resolved using in situ neutron
<br>   reflectometry with contrast matching. We find that electrolyte
<br>   constituents ingress into the self-assembled monolayer of dye molecules
<br>   that anchor onto TiO2. Some dye/TiO2 anchoring configurations are
<br>   modulated by the formation of electrolyte/dye intermolecular
<br>   interactions. These electrolyte-influencing structural changes will
<br>   affect dye-regeneration and electron-injection DSC operational
<br>   processes. This underpins the importance of this in situ structural
<br>   determination of electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfaces within representative

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Combustion synthesis is a well-known method for synthesis of transparent
<br>   metal oxide thin films at low temperature (<400 degrees C). However,
<br>   their functional properties are often inferior due to high residual
<br>   porosity originating from a release of large amounts of gaseous products
<br>   during combustion reaction. In this paper, indium tin oxide (ITO)
<br>   transparent conductive oxide thin films are prepared through combustion
<br>   synthesis at 350 degrees C and the porosity issue is explored via
<br>   multilayer deposition. When the thickness of individual layers is
<br>   downscaled from 12 to 3 nm, the density increases from 5.8 to 7.0 g
<br>   cm(-3) and porosity decreases from 20 to 3%. This causes a strong boost
<br>   of conductivity sigma (f) from 220 to 620 S cm(-1), the latter being one
<br>   of the highest values ever reported for low-temperature processed ITO
<br>   films. The effectiveness of this approach is attributed to a large
<br>   specific surface area of thinner individual layers, which strongly
<br>   enhances gas transport during the combustion process. We also show that
<br>   improved crystallinity and a strong increase in tensile in-plane stress
<br>   strongly contribute to the boost in conductivity.</td>

<br>   the cubic Heusler compound Co2MnGa due to its inherent magnetic and
<br>   topological properties. This work presents the structural, magnetic and
<br>   electronic properties of magnetron co-sputtered Co2MnGa thin films, with
<br>   thicknesses ranging from 10 to 80 nm. Polarized neutron reflectometry
<br>   confirmed a uniform magnetization through the films. Hard x-ray
<br>   photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a high degree of spin polarization
<br>   and localized (itinerant) character of the Mn d (Co d) valence electrons
<br>   and accompanying magnetic moments. Further, broadband and field
<br>   orientation-dependent ferromagnetic resonance measurements indicated a
<br>   relation between the thickness-dependent structural and magnetic
<br>   properties. The increase of the tensile strain-induced tetragonal
<br>   distortion in the thinner films was reflected in an increase of the
<br>   cubic anisotropy term and a decrease of the perpendicular uniaxial term.
<br>   The lattice distortion led to a reduction of the Gilbert damping
<br>   parameter and the thickness-dependent film quality affected the
<br>   inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. These experimental findings will
<br>   enrich the understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of
<br>   magnetic Weyl semimetal thin films.</td>

<br>   results of Cr/Ti multilayers with 10 bilayers show that interface widths
<br>   are reduced to similar to 0.24 nm upon introduction of a similar to 0.3
<br>   nm C barrier layer at each Cr-on-Ti interface. As the number of bilayers
<br>   increases to 75, a multilayer with C barrier layers maintains almost the

<br>   imperfections. Using such interface-engineered Cr/C/Ti multilayers, a

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) enhanced atomic layer etching (ALE) of thin
<br>   (similar to 8nm) Ru films is demonstrated. Oxidation half-cycles of
<br>   2-5min VUV/O-2 co-exposure are used to oxidize near-surface Ru to RuO2
<br>   at 1Torr O-2 and 100-150 degrees C. In situ x-ray photoelectron
<br>   spectroscopy measurements indicate that RuO2 formation saturates after
<br>   similar to 5min of VUV/O-2 exposure at 100 and 150 degrees C. The depth
<br>   of Ru oxidation is limited by the rate of oxidation and can be
<br>   controlled with substrate temperature and exposure time. Etching
<br>   half-cycles are performed by exposing the oxidized Ru film to HCOOH
<br>   vapor at 0.50Torr for 30s isothermally, which results in the removal of
<br>   the oxidized Ru layer. The amount of Ru removed per ALE cycle is
<br>   determined by comparing ex situ x-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements of
<br>   the film before and after etching. When using 2min VUV/O-2 co-exposure,
<br>   approximately 0.8 and 0.9 angstrom of Ru is etched per cycle at 100 and
<br>   150 degrees C, respectively. XRR and atomic force microscopy
<br>   measurements indicate that the as-deposited and sputtered Ru film
<br>   surface becomes smoother as ALE is performed. The etch rate decreases
<br>   with ALE cycles and corresponds to a slowing oxidation rate, which is
<br>   likely associated with the decrease in surface roughness. Density
<br>   functional theory is used to study the adsorption of oxidants in a model
<br>   Ru system, and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations describe O
<br>   diffusion into the Ru substrate by following an O ``probe'' atom as it
<br>   moves between Ru(002) atomic planes with 0.50 monolayer (ML) O on the
<br>   surface. NEB results reveal an approximate energetic barrier to
<br>   diffusion, E-a, of 5.10eV for O to move through the second and third
<br>   atomic Ru layers when O, which can form an RuOx species, is subsurface.
<br>   This E-a is in excess of the energetic gain of 4.23eV in adsorbing an O
<br>   atom to Ru(002) with 0.50ML O. The difference in E-a and the adsorption
<br>   energy likely contributes to the self-limiting nature of the oxidation
<br>   and explains the observation that VUV/O-2 co-exposure time must be
<br>   increased to allow additional time for O diffusing into the subsurface
<br>   as it overcomes the barrier to subsurface O diffusion. The self-limiting
<br>   oxidation of Ru arising from VUV/O-2 at low temperatures, in turn,
<br>   enables an ALE process for Ru.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a bottom-up surface functionalization to design hybrid
<br>   molecular coatings that tether biomembranes using wet chemistry. First,
<br>   a monolayer was formed by immersion in a NH2-Ar-SO3H solution, allowing
<br>   aryldiazonium salt radicals to spontaneously bind to it via strong C
<br>   bonding. After formation of the air-stable and dense molecular monolayer
<br>   (-Ar-SO3H), a subsequent activation was used to form highly reactive
<br>   -Ar-SO2Cl groups nearly perpendicular to the monolayer. These can bind
<br>   commercial surfactants, PEGylated oligomers and other inexpensive
<br>   molecules via their -OH, -COOH, or -NH2 chain end-moieties, to build
<br>   hybrid coatings. Metal and oxidized chromium, semi-conductor n-doped
<br>   silicon (111), are the substrates tested for this protocol and the
<br>   aromatic organic monolayers formed at their surface are characterized by
<br>   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS reveals unambiguously the
<br>   presence of C-Cr and C-Si bonds, ensuring robustness of the coatings.
<br>   Functional sulfur groups (-SO3H) cover up to 6.5 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of
<br>   the silicon interface and 4.7 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of the oxidized

<br>   coatings were analyzed by neutron reflectivity at the interface of
<br>   functionalized n-doped silicon substrates after immersion in a solution
<br>   of lipid vesicles and subsequent fusion. Results indicate a rather
<br>   compact hybrid coating of Brij anchor-harpoon molecules that maintain a
<br>   single lipid bilayer above the substrate, on top of a hydrated PEO

<br>   relevant ionic liquid (IL) when dispersed in a polar solvent has been
<br>   investigated at a gold electrode interface using neutron reflectivity
<br>   (NR). For all solutions studied, the addition of small amounts of water
<br>   led to clear changes in electroactive structuring of the IL at the
<br>   electrode interface, which was largely determined by the bulk IL
<br>   concentration. At a dilute IL concentration, the presence of water gave
<br>   rise to a swollen interfacial structuring, which exhibited a greater
<br>   degree of electroresponsivity with applied potential compared to an
<br>   equivalent dry solution. Conversely, for a concentrated IL solution, the
<br>   presence of water led to an overall thinning of the interfacial region
<br>   and a crowding-like structuring, within which the composition of the
<br>   inner layer IL layers varied systematically with applied potential.
<br>   Complementary nanotribotronic atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements
<br>   performed for the same IL concentration, in dry and ambient conditions,
<br>   show that the presence of water reduces the lubricity of the IL boundary

<br>   coefficient with applied potential was still achievable. Combined, these

<br>   inevitably will determine their applicability in tribotronic and

<br>   SnO epitaxial films were achieved on r-sapphire by pulsed laser
<br>   deposition. The quasi-2D SnO films have thicknesses ranging from 3.4 to
<br>   25.4 nm, allowing observation of quantum confinement effects in the

<br>   is around 19 nm. Below 19 nm, the films are strained compressively in

<br>   observed by UV-IR spectroscopy for the optical transition at the direct
<br>   bandgap. By fitting Brus equation, the reduced effective mass is deduced
<br>   to be 0.137 +/- 0.016 me. The exciton radius and binding energy are 4.62

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Manipulating topotactic phase transformations via orderly ion transfer
<br>   in complex oxides ABO(x) is ubiquitous in advanced applications such as
<br>   ionotronics, ion-batteries and catalysts. Most of such ion-mediated
<br>   transformations are accomplished by the transfer of oxygen or A-site
<br>   ions. However, implementing the transformation via the transfer of
<br>   B-site ions, despite the great challenge to overcome a large cohesive
<br>   energy, has unique advantage since they host most functional properties
<br>   of materials. Here, we present a tri-state phase transformation from
<br>   perovskite (P) to brownmillerite (BM) and to single-layered perovskite
<br>   (SL) structure via the concerted migration of oxygen and B-site Co-ions
<br>   in La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 thin films. Ac-STEM, XPS, XAS, PNR, magnetic and
<br>   electric measurements demonstrated that presented B-site Co-cation
<br>   transfer is along the CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer of the BM film, which
<br>   leads to the reconfiguration of 3d-electrons and spin state in remanent
<br>   Co ions and causes tremendous changes in magnetic and electric
<br>   properties: from canted-antiferromagnetic insulator in BM phase to
<br>   ferromagnetic insulator in SL phase. First-principles calculations
<br>   revealed that the La3+-doping at A-site largely reduces the cohesive
<br>   energy of Co-ions in CoO4 and destabilize the CoO4 tetrahedron of BM
<br>   phase, which explains the formation of Co-ions transfer channel in the
<br>   CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer. The present study highlights the
<br>   effectiveness of regulating topotactic transformation via B-site ions
<br>   transfer and provides a new pathway for manipulating the topotactic

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: One of the challenges of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is the
<br>   synthesis of oxides containing metals with high electronegativity
<br>   (metals that are hard to oxidize). The use of reactive organometallic
<br>   precursors can potentially address this issue. To investigate the
<br>   formation of radicals in MBE, we explored three carefully chosen
<br>   metal-organic precursors of tin for SnO2 and BaSnO3 growth:
<br>   tetramethyltin (TMT), tetraethyltin (TET), and hexamethylditin (HMDT).
<br>   All three precursors produced single-crystalline, atomically smooth, and
<br>   epitaxial SnO2 (101) films on r-Al2O3
<br>   ( 10
<br>   1 <overbar></mml:mover> 2 <mml:mo stretchy=''false''>) in the
<br>   presence of oxygen plasma. The study of growth kinetics revealed
<br>   reaction-limited and flux-limited regimes except for TET, which also
<br>   exhibited a decrease in the deposition rate with increasing temperature
<br>   above similar to 800 degrees C. Contrary to these similarities, the
<br>   performance of these precursors was dramatically different for BaSnO3
<br>   growth. TMT and TET were ineffective in supplying adequate tin, whereas
<br>   HMDT yielded phase-pure, stoichiometric BaSnO3 films. Significantly,
<br>   HMDT resulted in phase-pure and stoichiometric BaSnO3 films even without
<br>   the use of an oxygen plasma (i.e., with molecular oxygen alone). These
<br>   results are discussed using the ability of HMDT to form tin radicals and
<br>   therefore assisting with Sn -> Sn4+ oxidation reaction. Structural and
<br>   electronic transport properties of films grown using HMDT with and
<br>   without oxygen plasma are compared. This study provides guideline for
<br>   the choice of precursors that will enable the synthesis of metal oxides

<br>   in situ XRR and EC, the net number of electrons passing through the
<br>   PPy-electrolyte interface was deduced along with the potential-induced
<br>   thickness variations, indicating a complex exchange mechanism.
<br>   Evidently, along with the anion transfer, parallel charge compensation
<br>   by protons and a volume and electron compensating counterflow of solvent
<br>   molecules take place. Complementary time-dependent EC-XRR scans indicate
<br>   that these exchange mechanisms are individual in two potential ranges.
<br>   The low actuation along with a high pseudocapacitance suggest the fast
<br>   potentiodynamically deposited PPy film as a promising supercapacitor
<br>   material.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Density functional theory (DFT) is used to better understand the
<br>   oxidation of Pd metal using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light co-exposed
<br>   with O-2, which is known to produce O and O-3. The oxidation of Pd metal
<br>   arising from O, O-2, and O-3 is assessed on bare Pd, Pd with a 0.25
<br>   monolayer of adsorbed atomic O, and Pd with increasing O incorporation
<br>   into the substrate. DFT calculations are complemented experimentally by
<br>   co-exposing 20 nm Pd films to 1 Torr of O-2 and VUV photons (6.5 < h nu
<br>   < 11.3 eV) from a D-2 lamp at temperatures ranging from 50 to 200
<br>   degrees C and times from 30 s to 40 min. Oxidation of Pd is
<br>   characterized using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
<br>   Co-exposures at 50 degrees C and 1 Torr O-2 are performed with the Pd
<br>   illuminated by the VUV light and shadowed from the VUV light in
<br>   attempting to select for the oxidant that impinges on the Pd surface and
<br>   causes oxidation. Results suggest that atomic O incident from the gas
<br>   phase is responsible for oxidation of Pd, as no PdOx formation is
<br>   observed for the same time period with the sample shadowed. Growth of
<br>   PdOx via O diffusion is studied with the nudged elastic band method.
<br>   Atomic O diffusion through Pd has an activation energy barrier of
<br>   similar to 2.87 eV with respect to a surface O. This decreases to
<br>   similar to 1.80 eV once the 0.25 monolayer of O occupies the surface.
<br>   The extent of Pd oxidation is limited to the near-surface Pd region for
<br>   all times and temperatures investigated. PdOx formation does not appear
<br>   to exceed one to two atomic layers of Pd for conditions explored herein.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In the field of functional nanomaterials, core-satellite nanoclusters
<br>   have recently elicited great interest due to their unique optoelectronic
<br>   properties. However, core-satellite synthetic routes to date are
<br>   hampered by delicate and multistep reaction conditions and no practical
<br>   method has been reported for the ordering of these structures onto a
<br>   surface monolayer. Herein we show a reproducible and simplified thin
<br>   film process to fabricate bimetallic raspberry nanoclusters using block
<br>   copolymer (BCP) lithography. The fabricated inorganic raspberry
<br>   nanoclusters consisted of a similar to 36 nm alumina core decorated with
<br>   similar to 15 nm Au satellites after infusing multilayer BCP
<br>   nanopatterns. A series of cylindrical BCPs with different molecular
<br>   weights allowed us to dial in specific nanodot periodicities (from 30 to
<br>   80 nm). Highly ordered BCP nanopatterns were then selectively
<br>   infiltrated with alumina and Au species to develop multi-level
<br>   bimetallic raspberry features. Microscopy and X-ray reflectivity
<br>   analysis were used at each fabrication step to gain further mechanistic
<br>   insights and understand the infiltration process. Furthermore,
<br>   grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering studies of infiltrated
<br>   films confirmed the excellent order and vertical orientation over wafer
<br>   scale areas of Al2O3/Au raspberry nanoclusters. We believe our work
<br>   demonstrates a robust strategy towards designing hybrid nanoclusters
<br>   since BCP blocks can be infiltrated with various low cost salt-based
<br>   precursors. The highly controlled nanocluster strategy disclosed here
<br>   could have wide ranging uses, in particular for metasurface and optical
<br>   based sensor applications.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Water-gated organic field-effect transistors (WGOFETs) are relevant
<br>   devices for use in the fields of biosensors and biosystems. However,
<br>   real applications require very stringent performance in terms of
<br>   electrochemical stability and charge mobility to the organic
<br>   semiconductor in contact with an aqueous environment. Here, a
<br>   comparative study of two small-molecule electron-transporting
<br>   perylenediimide semiconductors, which differ only in the N-substituents
<br>   named PDIF-CN2 and PDI8-CN2 is reported. The two materials present
<br>   similar solid-state arrangements but, while the PDI8-CN2 shows a more 3D
<br>   growth modality and electron mobility independent of the semiconductor
<br>   layer thickness (approximate to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), the PDIF-CN2
<br>   has an almost-2D growth modality and the mobility increases with the
<br>   semiconductor film thickness, reaching a maximum value of approximate to
<br>   5 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 30 nm. Above this thickness, the PDIF-CN2
<br>   switches to a more 3D growth modality, and the mobility drops by one
<br>   order of magnitude. XRR analysis indicates that a PDIF-CN2 film can be
<br>   modeled as a dense layered structure in which each layer is decoupled
<br>   from the others due to the presence of fluorocarbon-chains. The
<br>   availability of additional pathways for charge transport from buried
<br>   layers and the 2D versus 3D growth can explain the mobility dependence
<br>   on the film thickness.</td>

<br>   thoroughly by specular grazing incidence X-ray reflectivity (GIXR) and
<br>   diffused X-ray scattering (both in coplanar and non-coplanar
<br>   configurations) measurements. The investigation is important for
<br>   development of Cr/Ti soft X-ray multilayer mirrors for ``water
<br>   window'' applications in the wavelength regime of 2.2-4.4 nm.
<br>   Initially few multilayers have been deposited and the highest
<br>   reflectivity at first Bragg peak positions of the GIXR plots have been
<br>   obtained for the Cr layer to bi-layer thickness ratio of 0.4.
<br>   Subsequently, keeping the ratio fixed a set of five samples with
<br>   bi-layer thickness varying from 3.8 nm to 2.1 nm have been prepared. For
<br>   the all five ML samples reported in this communication, Ti layer
<br>   thickness is greater than 1.3 nm, however, the Cr layer thickness varies
<br>   from 1.5 to 0.8 nm in the above range of bi-layer thickness and it
<br>   undergoes continuous-to discontinuous transition. Cr films undergo
<br>   significant change in morphology as the thickness changes and thus the
<br>   interfaces are also evolved differently. Analysis of the diffused X-ray
<br>   scattering data shows that interface imperfection of Ti-on-Cr interfaces
<br>   is dominated by interface diffusion at low Cr thickness (discontinuous)
<br>   regime and by interface roughness at high Cr thickness (continuous)
<br>   regime, while in case of Cr-on-Ti interfaces, interface roughness
<br>   dominates throughout the whole thickness regime. For the sample with
<br>   highest bi-layer thickness of 3.8 nm high Bragg peak reflectivity value
<br>   close to the ideal case is obtained manifesting high thickness
<br>   uniformity, very low interface imperfection and high vertical
<br>   correlation length across the interfaces for this sample which is also
<br>   confirmed by cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy. A 50
<br>   bi-layer sample prepared with the above bi-layer thickness shows high
<br>   reflectivity of 5.6% at 2.84 nm water window soft X-ray wavelength.</td>

<br>   It turns out that the planarity of the single-crystalline IrO2(110) film
<br>   is lost in that IrO2(110) oxide domains delaminate at a cathodic
<br>   potential of -0.18 V. Obviously, the electrolyte solution is able to

<br>   RuO2(110) structure-directing template is reduced to amorphous hydrous

<br>   adhesion to the template. From in situ XRR experiments we find that the

<br>   a controllable growth of continuous HfS(2)films with selectivity for
<br>   specific surfaces at a low temperature on a large scale has not been
<br>   demonstrated yet. Herein, HfS(2)films are grown at 100 degrees C by
<br>   atomic layer deposition (ALD) based on the precursors
<br>   tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium and H2S. In situ vibrational spectroscopy
<br>   allows for the definition of the temperature range over which
<br>   (Me2N)(4)Hf chemisorbs as one monolayer. In that range, sequential

<br>   nm, as demonstrated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, XRR, AFM, UV-vis and

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The emergence of thin film CoFeB has driven research and industrial
<br>   applications in the past decades, with the magnetic random access memory
<br>   (MRAM) the most prominent example. Because of its beneficial properties,
<br>   it fulfills multiple functionalities as information-storing,
<br>   spin-filtering, and reference layer in magnetic tunnel junctions. In
<br>   future, this versatility can be exploited beyond the traditional
<br>   applications of spintronics by combining with advanced materials, such
<br>   as oxide-based materials. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is their
<br>   predominant growth-method, and thus the compatibility of CoFeB with this
<br>   growth technique will be tested here. This encompasses a comprehensive
<br>   investigation of the structural and magnetic propoperties. In
<br>   particular, we find a substantial `dead' magnetic layer and confirm that
<br>   it is caused by oxidation employing the x-ray magnetic circular
<br>   dichroism (XMCD) effect. The low damping encountered in vector network
<br>   analyzer-based ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) renders them suitable

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Artificial ferromagnetic (FM)/nonmagnetic multilayers, with large enough
<br>   FM thickness to prevent the dominance of interface anisotropies, offer a
<br>   straightforward insight into the understanding and control of
<br>   perpendicular standing spin wave (PSSW) modes. Here we present a study
<br>   of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of [Co(3.0
<br>   nm)/Au(0.6nm)](1 <= N <= 30) multilayers. Magnetometry reveals that the
<br>   samples exhibit magnetization reversal properties typical of an
<br>   effective single layer with weak perpendicular anisotropy, with the
<br>   distinctive thickness-dependent magnetization reorientation transition
<br>   from uniform in-plane to out-of-plane stripe domains at remanence.
<br>   However, when such multilayer systems are out-of-plane saturated, the
<br>   dynamic response reveals the existence of several different
<br>   ferromagnetic resonances in the form of PSSW modes that strongly depend
<br>   on the material modulation characteristics along the total thickness.
<br>   These modes are induced by the layer stacking itself as the effective
<br>   single layer model fails to describe the observed complex dynamics. In
<br>   contrast to most systems considered in the past, described by a dynamic
<br>   model of a single effectively homogeneous thick layer, the specific
<br>   structures investigated here provide a unique platform for a large
<br>   degree of tunability of the mode frequencies and amplitude profiles. We
<br>   argue that the combination of periodic magnetic properties with vertical
<br>   deformation gradients, arising from heteroepitaxial strain relaxation,
<br>   converts the Au interlayer regions into a vertical regular array of
<br>   magnetic pinning planes for the PSSW modes, which promotes the complex

<br>   At the lowest concentration (5% w/w), a preferential adsorption of the

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: During the 1990s, Roger Cowley had a strong interest in the crystal and
<br>   magnetic structures of rare-earth superlattices as a means to understand
<br>   the rich and exotic magnetic properties of the rare-earth metals.
<br>   High-quality samples can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire
<br>   substrates by first depositing a thin epitaxial layer of niobium, then a
<br>   layer of yttrium or lutetium as a seed. High-resolution x-ray scattering
<br>   is an excellent probe to characterise the crystal quality and was used
<br>   to study the structure of the niobium layer. However, relatively little
<br>   attention was paid to the seed layer. This article summarises some of
<br>   the x-ray experiments performed by the Cowley group to study the
<br>   structure of epitaxial (110) niobium on (11 (2) over bar0) sapphire, and
<br>   extends the work to report some results on the structure of thin (0 00
<br>   1) yttrium seed layers. The structure of the yttrium films is shown to
<br>   have a strong dependence on the thickness of the niobium buffer, with
<br>   the buffer needing to be thicker than a critical value of similar to 80
<br>   degrees A for the formation of misfit dislocations at the Nb/Al2O3
<br>   interface before highly coherent Y films can be grown. Yttrium films
<br>   grown on Nb buffers thinner than similar to 500 degrees A show a similar
<br>   two-peak line shape in q(perpendicular to) scans through their specular
<br>   Bragg peaks to that seen in the specular Nb Bragg peaks, with a
<br>   resolution-limited feature on a broader diffuse peak. The
<br>   resolution-limited feature depends on the thickness of the yttrium film,
<br>   becoming weaker and having a stronger decay with increasing q(parallel
<br>   to) as the film thickness increases, while the width of the yttrium
<br>   broad peak evolves as the square root of the width of the niobium Bragg
<br>   peak. The data are discussed within the context of theories describing
<br>   the scattering from films with misfit dislocations.</td>

<br>   of perpendicular magnetization in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/Ta
<br>   ultrathin films on a ferroelectric substrate. By measuring the anomalous

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Control of BO(6)octahedral rotations at the heterointerfaces of
<br>   dissimilar ABO(3)perovskites has emerged as a powerful route for
<br>   engineering novel physical properties. However, its impact length scale
<br>   is constrained at 2-6 unit cells close to the interface and the
<br>   octahedral rotations relax quickly into bulk tilt angles away from
<br>   interface. Here, a long-range (up to 12 unit cells) suppression of
<br>   MnO(6)octahedral rotations in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)through the formation
<br>   of superlattices with SrTiO(3)can be achieved. The suppressed
<br>   MnO(6)octahedral rotations strongly modify the magnetic and electronic
<br>   properties of La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)and hence create a new ferromagnetic
<br>   insulating state with enhanced Curie temperature of 235 K. The emergent
<br>   properties in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)arise from a preferential occupation
<br>   of the out-of-plane Mnd(3)(z)(-)(r)(2)(2)orbital and a reduced Mn
<br>   e(g)bandwidth, induced by the suppressed octahedral rotations. The
<br>   realization of long-range tuning of BO(6)octahedra via superlattices can
<br>   be applicable to other strongly correlated perovskites for exploring new

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient
<br>   information-storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been
<br>   experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including
<br>   ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of
<br>   skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful
<br>   pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions.
<br>   However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is
<br>   still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating
<br>   spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate
<br>   to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high-density
<br>   Neel-type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room
<br>   temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall
<br>   balance (core structure [Co/Pt](n)/NiO/[Co/Pt](n)) with interfacial
<br>   canted magnetizations because of interlayer
<br>   ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom
<br>   [Co/Pt](n)multilayers, where the Co layers in [Co/Pt](n)are always
<br>   ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the
<br>   generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer
<br>   exchange coupling (IEC) and easy-axis orientation. Direct experimental
<br>   evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided,
<br>   suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative
<br>   mechanism for room-temperature spintronics.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The cellular membrane is central to the development of single-and
<br>   multicellular life, as it separates the delicate cellular interior from
<br>   the hostile environment. It exerts tight control over entry and exit of
<br>   substances, is responsible for signaling with other cells in
<br>   multicellular organisms and prevents pathogens from entering the cell.
<br>   In the case of bacteria and viruses, the cellular membrane also hosts
<br>   the proteins enabling invasion of the host organism. In a very real
<br>   sense therefore, the cellular membrane is central to all life. The study
<br>   of the cell membrane and membrane proteins in particular has therefore
<br>   attracted significant attention. Due to the enormous variety of tasks
<br>   performed by the membrane, it is a highly complex and challenging
<br>   structure to study. Ideally, membrane components would be studied in
<br>   isolation from this environment, but unlike water soluble proteins, the
<br>   amphiphilic environment provided by the cellular membrane is key to the
<br>   structure and function of the cell membrane. Therefore, model membranes
<br>   have been developed to provide an environment in which a membrane
<br>   protein can be studied. This review presents a set of tools that enable
<br>   the comprehensive characterization of membrane proteins: electrochemical
<br>   tools, surface plasmon resonance, neutron scattering, the surface forces
<br>   apparatus and atomic force microscopy are discussed, with a particular
<br>   focus on experimental technique and data evaluation.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: We studied the magnetization (M-s) of 60 nm thick polycrystalline Fe4N
<br>   thin films deposited using reactive dc magnetron sputtering. The optimum
<br>   substrate temperature (T-s) to grow an stoichiometric Fe4N phase is
<br>   about 673 K, in agreement with earlier works. However, at this T-s, we
<br>   found that significant intermixing is taking place at the substrate-film
<br>   interface, affecting the M-s of Fe4N film, adversely. We performed
<br>   secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements to extract the
<br>   extent of such intermixing. It was found that Si from the SiO2 substrate
<br>   get interdiffused into Fe4N film forming an undesired interface
<br>   extending up to almost half of the film. As a result, the average M-s of
<br>   Fe4N film get reduced by about 25% as compared to its theoretical
<br>   value. To prohibit such intermixing, we placed thin layers of Ag, Cu, or
<br>   CrN as a buffer layer between the substrate and Fe4N film. Such buffer
<br>   layer suppress the extent of interdiffusion remarkably. From SIMS
<br>   measurements, we found that among all buffer layers, CrN is most
<br>   suitable as it reduces the extent of intermixing to a minimum level.
<br>   Magnetization measurements performed using bulk magnetization and
<br>   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) methods also clearly revealed that
<br>   the M-s was the highest when CrN buffer layer was used. From these
<br>   results, it becomes apparent that the intermixing taking place at the
<br>   substrate-film interface plays a vital role in affecting the M-s of Fe4N
<br>   thin films. To further suppress such intermixing an attempt was also
<br>   made to bring down the T-s from 673 to 523 K. Obtained results are
<br>   presented and discussed in this work.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In solid-state chemistry, the direct reaction of elements at low

<br>   and the limited number of processing parameters often prevent the
<br>   synthesis of metastable compounds. Precisely controlling the number of
<br>   atoms and nanoarchitecture of layered elemental precursors enabled the
<br>   selective synthesis of two closely related metastable tin vanadium
<br>   selenides via near-diffusionless reactions at low temperatures. Although
<br>   the nanoarchitectures of the precursors required to form
<br>   [(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) and [(SnSe)(1.15)](1) (VSe2)(1) are very

<br>   into the self-assembly process. A reaction mechanism is proposed and

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: To optimize the catalytic functionality of cerium oxide it is important
<br>   to understand the structural modifications associated with reduction and
<br>   the role of the proximity of metals, which are often coupled with the
<br>   oxide in the applications. For this purpose, the evolution of the short-
<br>   and long-range structure of cerium oxide ultrathin epitaxial films and
<br>   nanostructures supported on Pt(111) is investigated using X-ray
<br>   absorption spectroscopy at the Ce L(3)edge and surface X-ray
<br>   diffraction, during reduction by thermal treatments in vacuum. In
<br>   epitaxial nanoislands reduction is associated with a contraction of the
<br>   Ce-O distance and with the appearance of Ce-Pt bonds. The formation of a
<br>   phase with a (2 x 2) periodicity after a thermal treatment at 1023 K is
<br>   ascribed to the formation of a Pt5Ce alloy. Films of 3 nm thickness do
<br>   not show, on average, significant structural modifications with the same
<br>   thermal treatment, consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction
<br>   involves only the topmost surface layers and it does not influence
<br>   significantly the bulk structure of the material. This study
<br>   demonstrates a strong interaction between cerium oxide and platinum,

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The magnon diffusion length (MDL) is understood to play a major role in
<br>   the thickness dependence of spin Seebeck effect (SSE) voltages in
<br>   Fe3O4/Pt thin films. Here we extract the MDL in an Fe3O4 single crystal
<br>   using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and in Fe3O4/Pt thin films
<br>   using accurate heat flux SSE and static magnetization measurements. The
<br>   INS MDLs were 34 +/- 8 nm at 300 K and 27 +/- 6 nm at 50 K. The SSE MDLs
<br>   decreased with temperature (19 +/- 2 nm at 300 K and 13 +/- 4 nm at 50
<br>   K), but were markedly smaller. Whilst the bulk MDL is expected to be an
<br>   upper limit of the MDL in thin films, we show that the film
<br>   magnetization must be considered to obtain MDLs from SSE measurements.
<br>   This study highlights the importance of disentangling the role of
<br>   various effects in SSE measurements which is crucial in increasing the
<br>   efficiencies of thermomagnetic energy harvesting devices.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: At an interface between a topological insulator (TI) and a conventional
<br>   superconductor (SC), superconductivity has been predicted to change
<br>   dramatically and exhibit novel correlations. In particular, the induced
<br>   superconductivity by an s-wave SC in a TI can develop an order parameter
<br>   with a p-wave component. Here we present experimental evidence for an
<br>   unexpected proximity-induced novel superconducting state in a thin layer
<br>   of the prototypical TI, Bi2Se3 proximity coupled to Nb. From
<br>   depth-resolved magnetic field measurements below the superconducting
<br>   transition temperature of Nb, we observe a local enhancement of the
<br>   magnetic field in Bi2Se3 that exceeds the externally applied field, thus
<br>   supporting the existence of an intrinsic paramagnetic Meissner effect
<br>   arising from an odd-frequency superconducting state. Our experimental
<br>   results are complemented by theoretical calculations supporting the
<br>   appearance of such a component at the interface which extends into the
<br>   TI. This state is topologically distinct from the conventional
<br>   Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state it originates from. To the best of our
<br>   knowledge, these findings present a first observation of bulk
<br>   odd-frequency superconductivity in a TI. We thus reaffirm the potential
<br>   of the TI-SC interface as a versatile platform to produce novel
<br>   superconducting states.</td>

<br>   SrxNbO3 with x < 1 is ideally suited as a UV-transparent electrode
<br>   material, enabling UV light-emitting diodes for a wide range of
<br>   applications from water disinfection to polymer curing. It is
<br>   demonstrated that SrxNbO3 thin films can be grown by radio frequency
<br>   (RF) sputtering and that they remain in the perovskite phase despite a
<br>   sizeable Sr deficiency. The electrical and optical properties are
<br>   characterized and compared to those of commonly used indium tin oxide
<br>   (ITO) and Sn-doped Ga2O3 transparent conductor standards. SrxNbO3 films
<br>   were found to have sheet resistances as low as 30 Omega sq(-1) with
<br>   optical transmission at a wavelength of 280 nm up to 86%, marking a
<br>   two-order-of-magnitude increase over the performance of traditional

<br>   vapor deposition technique that is widely employed in the transparent

<br>   resistive switching memory and piezoelectric microelectrochemical
<br>   devices are relevant applications. The films are mostly fabricated from
<br>   the vapour phase or by solution deposition. Processing conditions with a
<br>   limited thermal budget typically yield nanocrystalline or amorphous
<br>   layers. For these aperiodic materials, the structure is described in
<br>   terms of the local atomic order on the length scale of a few chemical
<br>   bonds up to several nanometres. Previous structural studies of the
<br>   short-range order in thin films have addressed the simple case of single

<br>   how to probe the local structure of two stacked functional layers by
<br>   means of grazing incidence total X-ray scattering and pair distribution
<br>   function (PDF) analysis. The key to separating the contributions of the
<br>   individual thin films is the variation of the incidence angle below the
<br>   critical angle of total external reflection, In this way, structural
<br>   information was obtained for functional oxides on textured

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The Pb(II)-binding mechanism on an annealed hematite (1 (1) over bar 02)
<br>   surface was studied using crystal truncation rod (CTR) X-ray diffraction
<br>   coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The best fit
<br>   CTR model suggested that Pb(II) sorbed selectively to one type of
<br>   edge-sharing surface site (ES2) over two other potential surface sites.
<br>   From the best fit model structure, it was found that the Pb surface
<br>   complex species forms a trigonal pyramid geometry. The base consists of
<br>   three oxygen groups, two of which are associated with the substrate
<br>   surface (O-I and O-III) and one that is a distal O extending toward
<br>   solution. The trigonal pyramid geometry is slightly distorted with Pb-O
<br>   bond lengths ranging from 2.21 to 2.31 angstrom and O-Pb-O bond angles
<br>   ranging from 72 degrees to 75 degrees. Under this structural distortion,
<br>   the nearest distance between Pb and Fe is found to be 3.39(1) angstrom.
<br>   Consistent with the CTR results, DFT calculations indicate the Pb
<br>   binding energy at the ES2 site is at least 0.16 eV more favorable than
<br>   that at the other two potential binding sites considered. Using
<br>   bond-valence rules we propose a stoichiometry of Pb(II) binding on the
<br>   hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface which indicates proton release
<br>   through the deprotonation of all oxygen groups bonding to Pb.</td>

<br>   indicates that DIO aggravates the PBDB-T enrichment region at the air

<br>   Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling

<br>   results indicate that the removal of -OO from the Ru-CUS site, which is
<br>   stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a neighbouring -OH (-OO-H), could be
<br>   the rate-determining step for (100) (similarly for (110)), where its

<br>   (SSA) and recrystallization in Ni/Ti multilayers. In this communication,
<br>   the effect of disorders present in the bulk Ni layers is studied on SSA
<br>   and recrystallization. The disorder in the Ni layers is created by
<br>   sputtering Ni layers of the Ni/Ti multilayers under the mixed ambience
<br>   of argon and nitrogen. It has been observed recently that the neutron
<br>   optical performances of Ni/Ti graded multilayers or supermirrors can be
<br>   improved by sputtering of Ni layers under the mixed ambience of argon
<br>   and nitrogen. In this work, Ni/Ti periodic multilayers deposited under
<br>   pure argon ambience and under mixed ambience of argon and nitrogen have
<br>   been annealed under vacuum at 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C, and 600
<br>   degrees C for 2 h. All the annealed multilayer samples along with
<br>   as-deposited multilayers are characterized by x-ray diffraction and
<br>   grazing incidence x-ray reflectivity measurements in specular and
<br>   non-specular modes. Atomic diffusion within the layers and across
<br>   interfaces has been studied as a function of annealing temperature for
<br>   both sets of multilayers. It is found that the interstitial nitrogen
<br>   atoms present in the Ni layers play a crucial role in the diffusivity at
<br>   room temperature as well as high temperature and thus influence the SSA
<br>   and recrystallization phenomena.</td>

<br>   interfaces is important to many of their applications, including in
<br>   energy storage solutions, sensors and advanced lubrication technologies
<br>   utilising electric fields. In the case of the latter, there is an
<br>   increasing demand for the study of non-halogenated ILs, as many
<br>   fluorinated anions have been found to produce corrosive and toxic
<br>   halides under tribological conditions. Here, the interfacial structuring
<br>   of a series of four imidazolium ILs ([C(n)C(1)Im]) of varying alkyl
<br>   chain lengths (n = 5, 6, 7, 10), with a non-halogenated borate-based
<br>   anion ([BOB]), have been studied at charged interfaces using sum
<br>   frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and neutron reflectivity (NR).
<br>   For all alkyl chain lengths, the SFG spectra show that the cation
<br>   imidazolium ring responds to the surface charge by modifying its
<br>   orientation with respect to the surface normal. In addition, the
<br>   combination of SFG spectra with electrochemical NR measurements reveals
<br>   that the longest alkyl chain length (n = 10) forms a bilayer structure
<br>   at all charged interfaces, independent of the ring orientation. These
<br>   results demonstrate the tunability of IL interfacial layers through the
<br>   use of surface charge, as well as effect of the cation alkyl chain
<br>   length, and provide valuable insight into the charge compensation
<br>   mechanisms of ILs.</td>

<br>   transport in crystalline organic semiconductors can effectively
<br>   facilitate reducing the sensitivity of charge carriers to thermal
<br>   energetic disorders existing in even single crystals to enhance the
<br>   carrier mobility. An isotropic transfer integral among adjacent
<br>   molecules enables a dimensional transition from quasi-one-dimensional to

<br>   packing, especially molecular rotation, was achieved in highly

<br>   integrals. Consequently, high-performance organic transistors with a

<br>   is grown by molecular beam epitaxy and the LSMO layer by high oxygen

<br>   transfer path is formed through the hydrogen-bonded water molecules with
<br>   protein around 55% relative humidity condition, and the protons are
<br>   transferred due to the gradient of absorbed water molecules within the
<br>   protein films. The devices are capable of harvesting electric power up
<br>   to 5.5 mu W/cm(2) with an induced voltage of 0.71 V. Our findings not

<br>   flexible and wearable applications. The devices showed exceptional
<br>   performance as humidity sensors and have been used for flexible
<br>   healthcare applications, such as continuous monitoring of breathing

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, Hf/ZrO2-based thin films have emerged as promising
<br>   candidates for ferroelectric materials in various applications. However,
<br>   achieving ferroelectricity with a low-temperature process has remained a
<br>   challenging task. In this study, the atomic layer plasma treatment
<br>   (ALPT) technique, where an in situ Ar plasma treatment is introduced
<br>   into each cycle of atomic layer deposition (ALD), was used to achieve
<br>   crystallization and ferroelectricity in as-deposited ZrO2 thin films at
<br>   a low temperature of 250 degrees C. The ALPT treatment effectively
<br>   contributes to a high-temperature annealing effect, leading to enhanced
<br>   crystallization and densification of the films. In addition, the ALPT
<br>   process also induces a transformation from paraelectric to ferroelectric
<br>   orthorhombic phase in the as-deposited ZrO2 thin films, exhibiting a
<br>   high ferroelectric switching polarization of 30 mu C cm(-2) along with
<br>   great endurance characteristics up to 10(8) switching cycles. This study
<br>   demonstrates that ALPT is an effective approach to enhance and tailor
<br>   the crystallization and dielectric characteristics of nanoscale thin
<br>   films at a low temperature, which is highly advantageous and demanded in
<br>   a variety of applications and research fields encompassing
<br>   nanoelectronic, energy storage, and biomedical devices.</td>

<br>   Their dynamic properties include resonant modes at frequencies higher
<br>   than can be observed in conventional ferromagnetic materials. An
<br>   alternative to single-phase antiferromagnets are synthetic
<br>   antiferromagnets (SAFs), engineered structures of exchange-coupled
<br>   ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers. SAFs have significant
<br>   advantages due to the wide-ranging tunability of their magnetic
<br>   properties and inherent compatibility with current device technologies,
<br>   such as those used for Spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access
<br>   memory production. Here we report the dynamic properties of fully
<br>   compensated SAFs using broadband ferromagnetic resonance and demonstrate
<br>   resonant optic modes in addition to the conventional acoustic (Kittel)
<br>   mode. These optic modes possess the highest zero-field frequencies

<br>   (RKKY) coupling, respectively. In contrast to previous SAF reports that
<br>   focus only on the first RKKY antiferromagnetic coupling peak, we show
<br>   that a higher optic mode frequency is obtained for the second
<br>   antiferromagnetic coupling peak. We ascribe this to the smoother

<br>   is analyzed in combination with ab initio finite difference method
<br>   calculations and spherical tensor analysis. It provides an assignment of

<br>   expected to exhibit a transition on the low-energy side of peak A3. Its
<br>   apparent absence in the experiment is related to the degree of p-d
<br>   orbital mixing which is small in rutile due to its centrosymmetric point
<br>   group. A recent XAS linear dichroism study on anatase TiO2 single

<br>   In this work, the crystallization of CoFeB alloys triggered by thermal
<br>   annealing was investigated by x-ray diffraction techniques and scanning
<br>   electron microscopy, as well as spectroscopic ellipsometry and
<br>   magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy for annealing temperatures
<br>   ranging from 300 to 600 degrees C. The transformation of similar to
<br>   100-nm-thick CoxFe(80-x)B20 films from amorphous to polycrystalline was
<br>   revealed by the sharpening of spectral features observed in optical and
<br>   magneto-optical dielectric functions spectra. The influence of B on the
<br>   dielectric function was assessed both experimentally and by optical
<br>   modeling. By analyzing the Drude component of the optical dielectric
<br>   function, a consistent trend between the charge-carrier scattering
<br>   time/resistivity and the annealing temperature was observed, in

<br>   at the interface. Developments in synchrotron X-ray sources,

<br>   Double-biased hysteresis loops with only one remanence state can be

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Arranging molecules into highly symmetric, topological crystal
<br>   structures has been recognized as the best approach to functionalize
<br>   electronic properties in molecular crystals, where the constituent
<br>   molecules have been assumed to be rigid in shape. Here, in striking
<br>   contrast, we demonstrate that the molecules in a monolayer organic
<br>   crystal can undergo a significant deformation in proximity to the
<br>   substrate, which is reflected by an asymmetry in the electron density
<br>   profile. X-ray reflectivity and X-ray absorption spectroscopies in
<br>   conjunction with density-functional theory calculations reveal that the
<br>   highly planarized pi-core are deformed into a bent shape, while the bulk
<br>   lattice parameters are maintained. The molecular shape change is found
<br>   to be perfectly suppressed in a bilayer single crystal, which leads to a
<br>   40% increase in mobility in the bilayer crystal. Our finding of a
<br>   unique, sub-molecular scale shape change in monolayer single crystals
<br>   can offer possibilities for functionalizing electrical properties via
<br>   nano-scale physisorption.
<br>   Organic molecules exhibit intrinsic semiconducting properties as well as
<br>   increased flexibility in comparison to their silicon counterparts and
<br>   consequently are playing an increasing role in semiconductor
<br>   technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate that monolayers of organic
<br>   crystals can undergo deformation at the molecular level when in
<br>   proximity to a substrate and that this has an effect on their electronic
<br>   structure.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is
<br>   one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults
<br>   worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a
<br>   mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional
<br>   deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled
<br>   electrophysiological-mechanical model with several free parameters that
<br>   are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The
<br>   calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm
<br>   (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration
<br>   of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several
<br>   minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter
<br>   tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a
<br>   simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The
<br>   model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more
<br>   realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to
<br>   run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a
<br>   parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor
<br>   taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel
<br>   DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort
<br>   achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time.
<br>   While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the

<br>   (Black Dye). Results show that all three dyes form nanoaggregates in dye

<br>   nanoaggregate separations, sizes, distribution densities, and the extent
<br>   of short-range order within each dye self-assembly in the longitudinal
<br>   and lateral directions. Dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2

<br>   order of 156-198 nm, sizes that are comparable to the largest

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Behaviour of interface properties and propagation of interfacial atomic
<br>   diffusion have been investigated systematically in Co/Ti multilayers
<br>   with ultra-short (similar to 18 angstrom) bi-layer thickness. Co/Ti
<br>   multilayers with 10,20,40,60 and 80 bi-layers have been grown using an
<br>   indigenously built in-line dc magnetron sputtering system having
<br>   application as reflecting optics in the water window soft X-ray regime
<br>   of 23-44 angstrom. Specular and diffused Grazing Incidence X-ray
<br>   reflectivity measurements with hard X-rays have been used to evaluate
<br>   detailed interfacial structure of the multilayers. It is observed that
<br>   interfacial atomic diffusion of Co into Ti layers is significant in such
<br>   ultra-short period multilayer structures and it increases as more number
<br>   of layers are added in the multilayer stack. As a result of Co diffusion
<br>   into Ti the physical density of Ti layer increases and also effective
<br>   thickness of Co layer decreases. Since the thickness of the Ti layers
<br>   are in sub-nm range, it is found that this diffusion is not limited only
<br>   to the interface region of Co-on-Ti, rather it spreads throughout the
<br>   bulk of Ti layer. Finally, soft X-ray reflectivity measurement on the
<br>   multilayers with synchrotron radiation at 28 angstrom wavelength shows
<br>   that the peak reflectivity is limited by the significant diffusion at
<br>   the Co/Ti interfaces.</td>

<br>   deposition, the desired ferroelectric (FE) properties typically vanish
<br>   while extending the thickness beyond a limit of about 50 nm. Herein, the
<br>   successful fabrication of a 1 mu m-thick piezoelectric La:HfO2 film is
<br>   demonstrated using chemical solution deposition, paving the way toward
<br>   sensor and actuator applications. After identifying the optimal La
<br>   content, the film thickness is increased from 45 nm to 1 mu m.
<br>   Polarization and strain measurements evidence the persistence of the FE
<br>   properties at all thicknesses and even a slight improvement due to a
<br>   better orientation of the polar axis at higher thicknesses. Scanning
<br>   electron microscopy and X-ray reflectivity reveal a fine-grained
<br>   microstructure and a density of only 80% of the theoretical value,
<br>   which seems to be a common issue of solution-deposited HfO2-based films,
<br>   based on the performed literature survey. Using tilt-angle-dependent
<br>   X-ray diffraction scans, homogeneous nucleation is found to be the
<br>   likely root cause of the observed microstructure. It is suggested that
<br>   this microstructure issue is key for the optimization of cycling

<br>   degrees C. Using an array of synchrotron-based techniques, we followed
<br>   the change in oxide thickness, chemical composition, and the lateral
<br>   distribution of alloying elements. The impact of the oxygen chemical
<br>   potential is most visible at high temperatures where the oxide
<br>   composition changes from mostly Al based to mostly Mg based. This is in
<br>   stark contrast to the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions where only a
<br>   partial compositional transition is observed. The microscopy data
<br>   demonstrate that in the UHV case, Mg segregation onto the surface occurs
<br>   firstly at grain boundaries at 300 degrees C and secondly at sites over
<br>   the entire surface at 400 degrees C. Further, the initial oxide
<br>   thickness is 45 angstrom, as determined by XPS and XRR, decreases in all
<br>   observed cases after heating to 300 degrees C. At higher temperatures,
<br>   however, the oxygen partial pressure highly influences the resulting
<br>   oxide thickness as evident from our X-ray reflectivity data.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Epitaxial Fe4N thin films grown on LaAlO3 (LAO) substrate using
<br>   sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy techniques have been studied in
<br>   this work. Within the sputtering process, films were grown with
<br>   conventional direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and using a high
<br>   power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) process. Surface morphology
<br>   and depth profile studies on these samples reveal that HiPIMS deposited
<br>   film has the lowest roughness, the highest packing density, and the
<br>   sharpest interface. We found that the substrate-film interface and the
<br>   microstructure play a vital role in affecting the electronic
<br>   hybridization and magnetic properties of Fe4N films. La from the LAO
<br>   substrate and Fe from the film interdiffuse and form an undesired
<br>   interface. The magnetic moment (M-s) was compared using bulk,
<br>   element-specific and magnetic depth profiling techniques. We found that
<br>   M-s was the highest when the thickness of the interdiffused layer was
<br>   lowest and such conditions can only be achieved in the HiPIMS grown
<br>   samples. The presence of a small moment at the N site was also evidenced
<br>   by element-specific x-ray circular dichroism measurement in the HiPIMS
<br>   grown sample. A large variation in the M-s values of Fe4N films found in
<br>   the experimental works carried out so far could be due to such an
<br>   interdiffused layer which is generally not expected to form in otherwise
<br>   stable oxide substrate at a low substrate temperature approximate to
<br>   675K. In addition, a consequence of substrate-film interdiffusion and
<br>   microstructure resulted in the different kinds of magnetic anisotropies
<br>   in Fe4N films grown using different techniques. A detailed investigation
<br>   of the substrate-film interface and microstructure on the magnetization
<br>   of Fe4N film is presented and discussed in this work.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Spin state transition in perovskite cobaltite is delicately controlled
<br>   by the competition between exchange interaction energy and crystal-field
<br>   energy. The latter is mainly governed by the change of bond length and
<br>   bonding angle. Previous work has revealed that the electronic
<br>   configuration associated with spin state transition in LaCoO3 (LCO) thin
<br>   films can be effectively modulated by epitaxial strain. However, a
<br>   systematic study on the spin state transition of Co3+ ions in LCO films
<br>   with different crystallographic symmetry is still missing. Here, keeping
<br>   the in-plane strain unchanged, we report that the magnetization of LCO
<br>   films can be manipulated with crystallographic symmetry. The ultrathin
<br>   LCO layers, constrained by the cubic substrate, have pseudotetragonal
<br>   structure and small magnetization. Upon increasing the layer thickness,
<br>   the monoclinic structure dominates the LCO film and maximizes its
<br>   ferromagnetism. For the LCO films with a thickness beyond 35 unit cells,
<br>   the symmetry relaxes gradually towards its rhombohedral bulk form, and
<br>   meanwhile the magnetization reduces. These results highlight the
<br>   importance of spin-lattice entanglement in a ferroelastic material and
<br>   provide a concise way to maximize its functionality using symmetry
<br>   engineering.</td>

<br>   device applications using tris(isopropylcyclopentadienyl)- praseodymium
<br>   (Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3)), trimethylaluminum (AlMe3), and water.
<br>   Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) was first evaluated as a precursor for the formation
<br>   of thin films of the binary oxide Pr2O3 by using water as the
<br>   coreactant. Self-limited growth of Pr2O3 was demonstrated for pulse
<br>   lengths of >= 3 s, with a growth rate of similar to 0.85 angstrom/cycle.
<br>   The ALD growth of PrAlO3 films was examined on Si, thermal SiO2, and
<br>   (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Self-limited growth was demonstrated
<br>   for Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3), AlMe3, and water at 300 degrees C by using a 1:1
<br>   ratio of the number of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses. An ALD
<br>   window was observed from 275 to 325 degrees C with a growth rate of
<br>   similar to 1.7 angstrom/cycle. The as-deposited PrAlO3 films on all
<br>   substrates were amorphous, had smooth surfaces, and contained <0.5%
<br>   carbon, as analyzed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering,
<br>   X-ray reflectivity, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively.
<br>   Films grown with a 1:1 ratio of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses were
<br>   aluminum-rich (Pr:Al similar to 1:1.2-1.4). Heating PrAlO3 layers
<br>   deposited on SrTiO3 to 800 degrees C for 3 h resulted in fully
<br>   crystallized PrAlO3 films. The crystallized PrAlO3 films were highly
<br>   (001)-oriented. The PrAlO3 00L and SrTiO3 00L reflections appeared on
<br>   the same rod of reciprocal space, further indicating that the amorphous
<br>   PrAlO3 film transforms into an epitaxial layer. The rocking curve width
<br>   of the PrAlO3 (001) reflection was 7 degrees. By contrast, PrAlO3 films
<br>   deposited on Si substrates with native oxide remained amorphous after
<br>   annealing at 1000 degrees C for 8 h. The difference in the
<br>   crystallization between PrAlO3 layers deposited on crystalline SrTiO3
<br>   and amorphous native SiO2 substrates indicates that PrAlO3 on SrTiO3
<br>   crystallized by solid-phase epitaxy, in which the nucleation and
<br>   orientation of the crystallized layer are set by the atomic
<br>   configuration at the substrate-film interface.</td>

<br>   be assigned to fcc Co rather than Co4N. On the other hand, the dcMS and
<br>   HiPIMS grown films clearly show the presence of Co4N phase even at T-s =
<br>   300 K. Detailed analysis of Co4N films grown using dcMS and HiPIMS
<br>   reveals that HiPIMS grown films are single phase and have a denser
<br>   microstructure. The density of HiPIMS deposited film was also found to
<br>   be close to the theoretical value. Magneto optical Kerr effect and
<br>   polarized neutron reflectivity measurements were carried out to study
<br>   magnetic properties. Differences in the magnetic moment and magnetic
<br>   anisotropy were correlated with structural parameters. Obtained results
<br>   are presented and discussed in terms of involved thin film growth

<br>   interfaces with a nanometer-thick interface layer of either nickel or
<br>   molybdenum is measured by time domain thermoreflectance and modeled
<br>   based on a 3-layer two-temperature model (3l-TTM). The rationale for
<br>   this study is to critically assess the role of the electron-phonon
<br>   coupling factor of the interlayer along with its thickness on the TBC.
<br>   It is shown that the TBC of both systems rapidly increases with the
<br>   interlayer thickness until reaching a stable plateau for thicknesses
<br>   greater than 1.5 nm. The plateau average value is 15%-25% lower than
<br>   the intrinsic TBC between the interlayer material and the diamond
<br>   substrate. This behavior and values of the TBC of both systems are in
<br>   good agreement with the predictions of the 3l-TTM. The predictability of
<br>   this model is also analyzed for a Cu interlayer inserted at Au/silicon
<br>   interfaces with thicknesses ranging from 1.5 to 20 nm. While the room
<br>   temperature TBC of this system is well described by the 3l-TTM, the
<br>   values measured at 80 K can only be predicted by the 3l-TTM, provided
<br>   that the interlayer electron-phonon coupling factor is reduced by a
<br>   factor of 2, as was experimentally observed for Ag and Au. The obtained
<br>   experimental results along with the proposed model can thus be useful
<br>   for tailoring the TBC of metallic interfaces in a wide range of
<br>   temperatures. Published under license by AIP Publishing.</td>

<br>   (TBC) at metal/dielectric interfaces. To this end, the TBC of Au/Si and
<br>   Ti/Si interfaces was measured by time domain thermoreflectance in the
<br>   as-deposited state and after various heat treatments. Transmission
<br>   electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the structure of the

<br>   interface was found to be highest in the as-deposited state and to be
<br>   somewhat reduced after heat treatments. TEM images showed that the
<br>   highest TBC was obtained when the interface contained a disordered
<br>   transition layer with some degree of interdiffusion as present in the
<br>   as-deposited state. Heat treatments led to the separation of species and
<br>   to more abrupt interfaces with lower TBC. Whether this change in TBC was
<br>   linked to disorder or to interdiffusion could not be distinguished. The
<br>   TBC at the Ti/Si interfaces was observed to decrease with the heat
<br>   treatment duration. TEM investigations revealed the presence of a thin

<br>   evolution of the TBC was hence rationalized by interdiffusion
<br>   facilitated by heat treatments that most likely modified the diffusion
<br>   zone thickness and chemical composition, as well as the disordered
<br>   layer's chemical composition. These changes result in modified
<br>   interfacial properties, which ultimately affect the TBC. A quantitative

<br>   deployment of electronic systems in the area of limited wired
<br>   power-supply, whereas the use of devices with reduced threshold-voltage
<br>   and power-consumption is essential for guaranteeing continuous working
<br>   capability. Herein, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was optimized by introducing Ge for
<br>   high-speed and low-energy phase change memory (PCM) application. The
<br>   high speed of 10 ns and the low threshold voltage of 1.6 V have been
<br>   achieved, originating from the crystal-like octahedral motifs in the
<br>   amorphous phase, in which crystallization can be accomplished by the
<br>   shifting or rotation of these motifs. The good endurance of 10(5) cycles
<br>   is due to the small volume change of 4.6% and the formation of a
<br>   homogenous phase during crystallization, which reduces the risk of
<br>   stress- and segregation-induced device failure. The nucleation-dominated

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Current induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in perpendicularly magnetized
<br>   heavy metal/ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal trilayers has been widely
<br>   studied to achieve the current-induced magnetization switching.
<br>   Decreasing the critical switching current-density (J(C)) is a primary
<br>   factor in the performance of memory or logic devices because J(C)
<br>   directly affects the power consumption of the devices. This work
<br>   demonstrates the influences of inserting a transition metal copper (Cu)
<br>   layer between the Co/Ta interface in the Pt/Co/Ta structures with
<br>   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) on the J(C), SOT, coercive
<br>   field, and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field (H-an). The results
<br>   show that J(C) decreases significantly when the thickness of Cu layer is
<br>   above 3 nm, compared with the Pt/Co/Ta control sample, under
<br>   consideration of the shunting effect of Cu layer. The decrease of J(C)
<br>   is the result of the competition between the modified SOT and H-an due
<br>   to the insertion of Cu. The study suggests that the critical switching
<br>   current-density of SOT-switching can be decreased by inserting a
<br>   transition metal Cu layer.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The depth-dependent magnetization in thin film oxygen stoichiometric and
<br>   oxygen-deficient La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 is investigated by using polarized
<br>   neutron reflectivity and DC bulk magnetometry. The polarized neutron
<br>   reflectivity results reveal that the stoichiometric sample shows
<br>   enhanced interfacial magnetization relative to the rest of the film. The
<br>   oxygen-deficient sample exhibits a reduced average magnetization from
<br>   the optimized recipe. Both films show regions of suppressed
<br>   magnetization at the surface regardless of the growth pressure. The
<br>   oxygen stoichiometric film does not show an interfacial dead layer,
<br>   whereas the oxygen-deficient film exhibits a dead layer whose thickness
<br>   changes with temperature. At a low applied field, we observe striking
<br>   differences in the depth dependence of the magnetic ordering, with the
<br>   oxygen-deficient film exhibiting exchange spring behavior, while the
<br>   stoichiometric film shows a constant magnetization direction across the
<br>   film. These results suggest that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies
<br>   during growth leads to an accumulation of vacancies at the interface,
<br>   which is enhanced at higher temperature due to increased oxygen
<br>   mobility, creating a region of reduced magnetism that couples to the
<br>   rest of the film. These results offer insight into the complex behavior
<br>   and role of oxygen vacancies in the magnetism of these systems.
<br>   Additionally, the study reveals further details of the negative

<br>   engineer their electronic properties instead of the more commonly used
<br>   cation substitution. In this work, epitaxial oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta
<br>   F gamma films were synthesized via topotactic fluorination of SrMnO2.5
<br>   films using polytetrafluoroethylene as the fluorine source. Oxidized
<br>   SrMnO3 films were also prepared for comparison with the fluorinated
<br>   samples. The F content, probed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, was
<br>   systematically controlled by adjusting fluorination conditions.
<br>   Electronic transport measurements reveal that increased F content (up to
<br>   gamma = 0.14) systematically increases the electrical resistivity,
<br>   despite the nominal electron-doping induced by F substitution for O in
<br>   these films. In contrast, oxidized SrMnO3 exhibits a decreased
<br>   resistivity and conduction activation energy. A blue-shift of optical
<br>   absorption features occurs with increasing F content. Density functional
<br>   theory calculations indicate that F acts as a scattering center for
<br>   electronic transport, controls the observed weak ferromagnetic behavior
<br>   of the films, and reduces the inter-band optical transitions in the
<br>   manganite films. These results stand in contrast to bulk electron-doped
<br>   La(1-x)Ce(x)Mno(3), illustrating how aliovalent anionic substitutions
<br>   can yield physical behavior distinct from A-site substituted perovskites

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In the present study we have demonstrated epitaxial stabilization of the
<br>   metastable magnetically hard epsilon-Fe2O3 phase on top of a thin
<br>   MgO(111) buffer layer grown onto the GaN (0001) surface. The primary
<br>   purpose to introduce a 4-nm-thick buffer layer of MgO in between Fe2O3
<br>   and GaN was to stop thermal migration of Ga into the iron oxide layer.
<br>   Though such migration and successive formation of the orthorhombic
<br>   GaFeO3 was supposed earlier to be a potential trigger of the nucleation
<br>   of the isostructural epsilon-Fe2O3, the present work demonstrates that
<br>   the growth of single crystalline uniform films of epsilon ferrite by
<br>   pulsed laser deposition is possible even on the MgO capped GaN. The
<br>   structural properties of the 60-nm-thick Fe2O3 layer on MgO/GaN were
<br>   probed by electron and x-ray diffraction, both suggesting that the
<br>   growth of epsilon-Fe2O3 is preceded by formation of a thin layer of
<br>   gamma-Fe2O3. The presence of the magnetically hard epsilon ferrite was
<br>   independently confirmed by temperature dependent magnetometry
<br>   measurements. The depth-resolved x-ray and polarized neutron
<br>   reflectometry reveal that the 10 nm iron oxide layer at the interface
<br>   has a lower density and a higher magnetization than the main volume of
<br>   the epsilon-Fe2O3 film. The density and magnetic moment depth profiles
<br>   derived from fitting the reflectometry data are in a good agreement with
<br>   the presence of the magnetically degraded gamma-Fe2O3 transition layer
<br>   between MgO and epsilon-Fe2O3. The natural occurrence of the interface
<br>   between magnetoelectric epsilon- and spin caloritronic gamma-iron oxide
<br>   phases can enable further opportunities to design novel

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: We present an extensive study on the effect of substrate orientation,
<br>   strain, stoichiometry, and defects on spin-ice physics in Ho2Ti2O7 thin
<br>   films grown onto yttria-stabilized-zirconia substrates. We find that
<br>   growth in different orientations produces different strain states in the
<br>   films. All films exhibit similar c-axis lattice parameters for their
<br>   relaxed portions, which are consistently larger than the bulk value of
<br>   10.1 angstrom. Transmission electron microscopy reveals antisite
<br>   disorder and growth defects to be present in the films, but evidence of
<br>   stuffing is not observed. The amount of disorder depends on the growth
<br>   orientation, with the (110) film showing the least. Magnetization
<br>   measurements at 1.8 K show the expected magnetic anisotropy and
<br>   saturation magnetization values associated with a spin ice for all
<br>   orientations; shape anisotropy is apparent when comparing in- and
<br>   out-of-plane directions. Significantly, only the (110)-oriented films
<br>   display the hallmark spin-ice plateau state in magnetization, albeit
<br>   less well defined compared to the plateau observed in a single crystal.
<br>   Neutron-scattering maps on the more disordered (111)-oriented films show
<br>   the Q = 0 phase previously observed in bulk materials, but the Q = X
<br>   phase giving the plateau state remains elusive. We conclude that the
<br>   spin-ice physics in thin films is modified by defects and strain,
<br>   leading to a reduction in the temperature at which correlations drive
<br>   the system into the spin-ice state.</td>

<br>   Nevertheless, a higher-order term being proportional to M-2 and called

<br>   range of 0.8-5.5 eV based on a modified eight-directional method applied
<br>   on ferromagnetic bcc Fe thin films grown on MgO substrates. From the

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic topological insulators (TIs) are an ideal playground for the

<br>   symmetry-broken topological surface states. By combining different
<br>   magnetic TIs in a heterostructure, their magnetic and electronic
<br>   properties can be precisely tuned. Recently, we have combined
<br>   high-moment Dy:Bi2Te3 with high transition temperature Cr: Sb2Te3 in a
<br>   superlattice, and we found, using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
<br>   (XMCD), that long-range magnetic order can be introduced in the
<br>   Dy:Bi2Te3 layers. Accompanying first-principles calculations indicated
<br>   that the origin of the long-range magnetic order is a strong
<br>   antiferromagnetic coupling between Dy and Cr magnetic moments at the
<br>   interface extending over several layers. However, based on XMCD alone,
<br>   which is either averaging over the entire thin-film stack or is
<br>   surface-sensitive, this coupling scenario could not be fully confirmed.
<br>   Here we use polarized neutron reflectometry, which is ideally suited for
<br>   the detailed study of superlattices, to retrieve the magnetization in a
<br>   layer- and interface-resolved way. We find that the magnetization is, in
<br>   contrast to similar recent studies, homogeneous throughout the
<br>   individual layers, with no apparent interfacial effects. This finding
<br>   demonstrates that heterostructure engineering is a powerful way of
<br>   controlling the magnetic properties of entire layers, with the effects

<br>   thickness and composition for both as-deposited and annealed materials
<br>   stacks. The coercivity and the anisotropy fields of annealed material
<br>   stacks are higher than for the as-deposited stacks due to
<br>   crystallisation of the ferromagnetic layer. Generally a critical
<br>   thickness of MgO > 1 nm provides adequate oxide formation at the top

<br>   that in stacks with Pt as the HM, the PMA depends crucially on the alloy
<br>   composition of the ferromagnet requiring a Co rich alloy to achieve PMA,
<br>   i.e. it is important to have a large number of Pt-Co hybrid bonds at the

<br>   of a multilayer stack is shown to change the PMA and strong PMA is found
<br>   for certain compositions of WxTa1-x that also result in very low
<br>   coercive fields (<1 mT) of the CoFeB. The PMA has also been shown to be
<br>   tuned via annealing, very strong anisotropy fields of up to 1 T and low

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In ferromagnet/heavy metal heterostructures, critical current density
<br>   (J(C)) refers to the minimum current density required to generate
<br>   spin-orbit torque (SOT) for effective magnetization manipulation,
<br>   including switching of magnetization and moving of domain walls and
<br>   magnetic skyrmions. This critical current density is a key factor for
<br>   next-generation SOT-based magnetic random access memory, racetrack
<br>   memory, and logic devices. In this work, the critical current density
<br>   for magnetization switching and the thermal stability of Pt/Co/Ta
<br>   heterostructures in response to ion irradiation are studied. It is found
<br>   that ion irradiation represents a promising approach for the wide tuning
<br>   of the magnetic properties, such as the coercive force and the
<br>   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy constant. It is also found that J(C)
<br>   is significantly reduced after 500eV Ar+ irradiation. Meanwhile, the
<br>   ratio between the thermal stability factor E/k(B)T and J(C) increases
<br>   with an increase in the irradiation dose, although E/k(B)T decreases
<br>   slightly with the irradiation dose. This work demonstrates that J(C) can
<br>   be significantly reduced by an appropriate ion irradiation process and
<br>   thereby demonstrates a promising approach for effective reduction of the
<br>   power consumption in SOT-based spintronic devices.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Nanolayer stacks are technologically very relevant for current and
<br>   future applications in many fields of research. A nondestructive
<br>   characterization of such systems is often performed using x-ray
<br>   reflectometry (XRR). For complex stacks of multiple layers, low electron
<br>   density contrast materials, or very thin layers without any pronounced
<br>   angular minima, this requires a full modeling of the XRR data. As such a
<br>   modeling is using the thicknesses, the densities, and the roughnesses of
<br>   each layer as parameters, this approach quickly results in a large
<br>   number of free parameters. In consequence, cross correlation effects or
<br>   interparameter dependencies can falsify the modeling results. Here, the
<br>   authors present a route for validation of such modeling results which is
<br>   based on the reference-free grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF)
<br>   methodology. In conjunction with the radiometrically calibrated
<br>   instrumentation of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, the method
<br>   allows for reference-free quantification of the elemental mass
<br>   depositions. In addition, a modeling approach of reference-free
<br>   GIXRF-XRR data is presented, which takes advantage of the quantifiable
<br>   elemental mass depositions by distributing them depth dependently. This
<br>   approach allows for a reduction of the free model parameters. Both the
<br>   validation capabilities and the combined reference-free GIXRF-XRR
<br>   modeling are demonstrated using several nanoscale layer stacks
<br>   consisting of
<br>   HfO 2 and
<br>   Al 2
<br>   O 3 layers.</td>

<br>   bringing down the growth temperature, we report the growth of
<br>   stoichiometric Co4N epitaxial thin films. Films were grown using a
<br>   direct current reactive magnetron sputtering process on LaAlO3 (LAO
<br>   mismatch 1.4%) and MgO (mismatch 11.3%) substrates and their
<br>   structural and magnetic properties were studied. Precise magnetic moment
<br>   (Ms) of Co4N samples were measured using polarized neutron reflectivity
<br>   and compared with bulk magnetization results. We found that the Ms of
<br>   Co4N is higher due to a magnetovolume effect. Unlike previous findings,
<br>   we observed that substrates induce misfit strain and strain
<br>   inhomogeneity is the cause of modifications in magnetic ensemble such as
<br>   coercivity, saturation magnetization, and magnetic anisotropy. A
<br>   consequence of incoherent strain present in our samples is also
<br>   reflected in the magnetic anisotropy leading to a superposition of
<br>   strong fourfold and a small fraction of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy.
<br>   Obtained results are presented and discussed in this work.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The availability of native substrates is a cornerstone in the
<br>   development of microelectronic technologies relying on epitaxial films.
<br>   If native substrates are not available, virtual substrates - crystalline
<br>   buffer layers epitaxially grown on a structurally dissimilar substrate -
<br>   offer a solution. Realizing commercially viable virtual substrates
<br>   requires the growth of high-quality films at high growth rates for
<br>   large-scale production. We report the stoichiometric growth of SrTiO3
<br>   exceeding 600 nm hr(-1). This tenfold increase in growth rate compared
<br>   to SrTiO3 grown on silicon by conventional methods is enabled by a
<br>   self-regulated growth window accessible in hybrid molecular beam
<br>   epitaxy. Overcoming the materials integration challenge for complex
<br>   oxides on silicon using virtual substrates opens a path to develop new
<br>   electronic devices in the More than Moore era and silicon integrated
<br>   quantum computation hardware.</td>

<br>   V-SCE. Experiments were conducted in selected acidic and alkaline

<br>   and Cr-species occurred in acidic electrolyte. Preferential dissolution
<br>   of Ni2+ at later times enabled gradual Cr3+ enrichment within the
<br>   surface film. However, greater relative stability of NiO and Ni(OH)(2)
<br>   was observed in the alkaline condition. Upon alloying Ni-Cr with Mo,

<br>   radiolysis in order to compare the radiolytic corrosion rates of UO2,
<br>   UN, and U2N3 thin films at room temperature. X-ray reflectivity was used
<br>   to investigate the changes in film morphology as a function of H2O2
<br>   exposure time, allowing changes in film thickness and roughness to be
<br>   observed on the Angstrom length-scale. Results showed significant
<br>   differences between UO2, UN, and U2N3, with corrosion rates of 0.083(3),
<br>   0.020(4), and 0.47(8) angstrom/s, respectively, showing that UN corrodes

<br>   improves under mild reducing conditions, and the surface Fe
<br>   stoichiometry changes with cathodic bias. After significant reductive
<br>   dissolution occurs and cathodic bias is removed, dissolved Fe is
<br>   redeposited, forming a disordered interface. Unlike at circumneutral pH,
<br>   water layers at the hematite interface with acidic solution are poorly

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Crystallization from an amorphous precursor presents a new route to
<br>   control the properties of complex oxides by selecting their nanoscale
<br>   morphology. A key challenge in crystal growth from the amorphous form is
<br>   to select the locations of nucleation and the crystallographic
<br>   orientation of the resulting crystals. Nucleation sites for
<br>   crystallization of the prototypical perovskite complex oxide SrTiO3
<br>   (STO) from its amorphous form can be reproducibly introduced using
<br>   nanoscale seed crystals. The results of two seeding strategies are
<br>   reported here: (i) SrRuO3 (SRO) (001)-oriented nanomembranes and (ii)
<br>   STO nanocrystalline seeds. Amorphous STO crystallizes laterally over
<br>   distances of several microns from the seeds before encountering
<br>   separately nucleated crystals. The lateral crystallization rates for
<br>   both types of seeding methods are close to the values measured in
<br>   solidphase epitaxy (SPE) of STO on single-crystal substrates. The
<br>   lateral crystallization distances along different crystallographic
<br>   orientations are equal, indicating that the lateral crystallization rate
<br>   is isotropic. The isotropic crystallization suggests that the
<br>   rate-limiting steps for crystallization occur within the amorphous STO
<br>   away from the amorphous/crystalline interface. In addition to the
<br>   lateral crystallization, STO crystallizes on top of the planar SRO
<br>   nanomembrane seeds via SPE, forming partially relaxed [001]-oriented
<br>   heteroepitaxial STO layers. The in-plane orientation of laterally
<br>   crystallized STO near the SRO nanomembrane seeds exhibits overall
<br>   polycrystallinity with regions in which micron-scale grains of laterally
<br>   crystallized STO share the same in-plane orientation as the SRO
<br>   nanomembrane seeds. Crystallization from seed crystals provides
<br>   opportunities to create a wide range of other perovskite oxides in

<br>   surfaces were tested. The detailed structure of these interfaces was
<br>   studied, allowing distinction of two different cases of M/Si couples:
<br>   (i) some amount of interfacial reaction exists for both surface

<br>   interfaces are achieved, resulting in TBC values that are always lower
<br>   for RF-etched samples. The TBC values obtained on different substrates
<br>   allowed identifying a tendency of the TBC to scale with the maximum
<br>   transmission limit. A possible influence of the substrate was evaluated
<br>   using both the diffuse mismatch model (DMM), which predicts a strong
<br>   dependence on the substrate properties, and a newly developed approach
<br>   based on the metal irradiance (IM), which predicts no dependence on the
<br>   substrate properties. The DMM was implemented using a Debye model with

<br>   while the IM was implemented using a Sine-Type (IMSineType) dispersion.
<br>   The DMMLinear and the IMSineType were found to be more suitable than the

<br>   metal/diamond interfaces. IMSineType being the only model tested that is
<br>   suitable for all three substrates, it appears to be the most appropriate

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that have been observed
<br>   in bulk magnets and magnetic multilayers. For bulk magnetic materials,
<br>   their noncollinear spin profiles have often been studied by using
<br>   Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We experimentally
<br>   utilized Lorentz TEM imaging to study an inversion asymmetric
<br>   [Pt(1.5nm)/Co(1 nm)/W(1 nm)](8) heterostructure that exhibits
<br>   Neel-type skyrmions at zero field. By tracking the evolution of skyrmion
<br>   diameters as a function of magnetic fields, we determined the strength
<br>   of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Our results
<br>   suggest that in situ Lorentz TEM imaging combined with simulations can
<br>   provide valuable quantitative information about the interfacial DMI
<br>   strengths, which can be helpful for optimizing skyrmion materials.
<br>   Furthermore, we show that in theory, Lorentz TEM can identify the spin
<br>   chirality of Neel-type skyrmions, although an experimental verification
<br>   is challenging due to the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio.</td>

<br>   mobility at room-temperature when doped with La3+. When a thin epitaxial
<br>   layer of LaInO3 is grown on lightly doped BaSnO3, a polar discontinuity
<br>   between the orthorhombic, polar LaInO3 and the cubic, nonpolar
<br>   Ba0.998La0.002SnO3 leads to an electronic reconstruction, where LaInO3
<br>   remotely dopes Ba0.998La0.002SnO3, creating carriers for high mobility

<br>   LaInO3/BaSnO3 film that affect the polar discontinuity using synchrotron

<br>   structural distortions are characterized by measuring half-order Bragg

<br>   pattern as that of bulk LaInO3, a(+)b(-)b(-), and a second rotated 90

<br>   observe a sudden and large increase in cation displacements along the

<br>   harvest all available sunlight when acting as co-sensitizers for
<br>   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Six promising dye combinations are
<br>   shortlisted for device testing, whereupon one dye combination yields
<br>   co-sensitized DSSCs with power conversion efficiencies comparable to

<br>   package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on
<br>   Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based,
<br>   through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being
<br>   composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the
<br>   interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters
<br>   (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model
<br>   and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the
<br>   residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system.
<br>   Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets
<br>   and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as
<br>   probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the
<br>   system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of
<br>   components, over and above those available from the parameters alone.
<br>   Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The software offers a
<br>   choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and
<br>   gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain
<br>   Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the
<br>   model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining
<br>   parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting
<br>   scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to
<br>   facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and
<br>   subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information,
<br>   permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Interfacial charge and strain distributions inside artificial perovskite
<br>   ABO(3) heterostructures often affect intriguing physical properties that
<br>   are important to device performance. Normally, both charge and strain
<br>   coexist across the interfaces, and their exact roles in determining the
<br>   properties remain elusive. In the present work, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)
<br>   ultrathin films were grown on (001)-0.7Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) O-3-0.3PbTiO(3)
<br>   (PMNPT) single-crystal substrates to discriminate between the effect of
<br>   charge and strain on the transport and magnetoelectric properties. In
<br>   heterostructures with thicker LSMO films, the strain effect dominates
<br>   the resistance and the magnetic moment depends on the external electric
<br>   field. With the decreasing LSMO thickness, the butterfly-like
<br>   resistance-electric-field (R-E) and magnetization-electric-field (M-E)
<br>   curves become loop-like, indicating that charge effects dominate strain
<br>   effects in determining the electric field that controls the transport
<br>   and magnetic properties. Furthermore, soft-x-ray absorption spectra of
<br>   32 and 4 nm LSMO/PMNPT samples at the Mn L edge under an applied
<br>   electric field of +/- 6 kV/cm indicate that orbital reconstruction also
<br>   plays an important role in interfacial magnetoelectric coupling.

<br>   a Ned structure stabilized by a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
<br>   that is generated at the interface between the ferromagnet and a heavy
<br>   metal. Different interface materials or properties are required above
<br>   and below a ferromagnetic film in order to generate the structural
<br>   inversion asymmetry needed to ensure that the DMI arising at the two
<br>   interfaces does not cancel. Here we report on the magnetic properties of
<br>   epitaxial Pt/Co/AuxPt1-x, trilayers grown by sputtering onto sapphire
<br>   substrates with 0.6 nm thick Co. As x rises from 0 to 1, a structural
<br>   inversion asymmetry is progressively generated. We characterize the
<br>   epilayer structure with x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional
<br>   transmission electron microscopy, revealing (111) stacking. The
<br>   saturation magnetization falls as the proximity magnetization in Pt is
<br>   reduced, whilst the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy K-u rises. The
<br>   micromagnetic DMI strength D was determined using the bubble expansion
<br>   technique and also rises from a negligible value when x = 0 to similar
<br>   to 1 mJ/m(2) for x = 1. The depinning field at which field-driven domain
<br>   wall motion crosses from the creep to the depinning regime rises from
<br>   similar to 40 to similar to 70 mT, attributed to greater spatial
<br>   fluctuations of the domain wall energy with increasing Au concentration.
<br>   Meanwhile, the increase in DMI causes the Walker field to rise from
<br>   similar to 10 to similar to 280 mT, meaning that only in the x = 1
<br>   sample is the steady flow regime accessible. The full dependence of
<br>   domain wall velocity on driving field bears little resemblance to the
<br>   prediction of a simple one-dimensional model, but can be described very
<br>   well using micromagnetic simulations with a realistic model of disorder.
<br>   These reveal a rise in Gilbert damping as x increases.</td>

<br>   characterizing such epitaxy in three-dimensions for low symmetry complex
<br>   tilt systems composed of light anions is a formidable challenge. Here we
<br>   demonstrate that the interfacial tilt epitaxy can transform ultrathin

<br>   multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) and ferromagnetic La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) offers
<br>   an opportunity to control magnetism in nanoscale heterostructures with
<br>   electric fields. In this paper, we investigate the influence of chemical
<br>   composition and crystallographic orientation on the interfacial
<br>   magnetism of BFO/LSMO superlattices. Our results reveal that the induced
<br>   net magnetic moment in the BFO layers increases monotonically with
<br>   increasing saturation magnetization of the LSMO layers. For the
<br>   (100)-BFO/LSMO (x = 0.2) superlattice, the induced moment reaches a
<br>   record high value of similar to 2.8 mu(B)/Fe. No interfacial
<br>   magnetization is observed at the (100)-BFO/LSMO interface when LSMO is
<br>   an antiferromagnet. In contrast to (100)-oriented superlattices, no
<br>   induced moment is observed in (111)-BFO layers. Our results suggest the
<br>   interfacial structural reconstruction may not be a sufficient condition
<br>   for the enhanced net moment in BFO layer. Instead, spin canting induced
<br>   by interfacial exchange coupling is proposed in the (100)-but not in the
<br>   (111)-BFO, leading to the large net magnetization at the (100)-oriented
<br>   interface. This work further demonstrates the importance of exchange
<br>   coupling across heterointerfaces for spin canting in nominally
<br>   antiferromagnets, providing a pathway to control the magnetic properties

<br>   Domain Thermoreflectance. Overall, a monotonic increase in the TBC was
<br>   observed over the first 10 nm, before reaching a plateau. In some cases,
<br>   it was also observed that an interlayer reduces the TBC as compared to
<br>   the reference system. This is rationalized by assuming that the TBC

<br>   a contribution of the gold layer that has to be taken into account for
<br>   all phonons having a wavelength larger than the interlayer thickness and
<br>   (ii) a thickness-dependent resistance within the interlayer that appears

<br>   [poly(9-ethyl-3-carbazolyl acrylamide) (pCzAA)], in which the
<br>   pi-conjugated unit is connected with a hydrophilic amide unit directly
<br>   as a side chain. Its Langmuir-Blodgett film formation properties were
<br>   investigated. The pCzAA polymer took a stable monolayer formation in the

<br>   (pDDA). Compared with amphiphilic carbazole-containing copolymers
<br>   described in earlier reports, the direct connection of pi-conjugated
<br>   units through amide bonding enables the Cz content in monolayers to
<br>   exceed that of the copolymer monolayers (ca. 30 mol %) dramatically.
<br>   pCzAA:pDDA takes highly ordered layer structures toward the out-of-plane
<br>   direction, although no structural order is formed in the in-plane

<br>   sorbed Pb was found to form inner sphere (IS) complexes at two types of
<br>   edge-sharing sites on the half layer termination of the hematite (1 (1)
<br>   over bar 02) surface. The best fit model contains Pb in distorted
<br>   trigonal pyramids with an average Pb-O bond length of 2.27(4) angstrom
<br>   and two characteristic Pb-Fe distances of 3.19(1) angstrom and 3.59(1)
<br>   angstrom. In addition, a site coverage model was developed to simulate
<br>   coverage as a function of sorbate-sorbate distance. The simulation
<br>   results suggest a plausible Pb-Pb distance of 5.42 angstrom, which is
<br>   slightly larger than the diameter of Pb's first hydration shell. This
<br>   relates the best fit surface coverage of 0.59(4) Pb per unit cell at
<br>   monolayer saturation to steric constraints as well as electrostatic
<br>   repulsion imposed by the hydrated Pb complex. Based on the structural
<br>   results we propose a stoichiometry of the surface complexation reaction
<br>   of Pb(II) on the hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface and use bond
<br>   valence analysis to assign the protonation schemes of surface oxygens.
<br>   Surface reaction stoichiometry suggests that the proton release in the
<br>   course of surface complexation occurs from the Pb-bound surface O atoms
<br>   at pH 5.5. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

<br>   (electro)chemical reactions in aqueous solutions or in humid
<br>   environments. However, the study of the interaction of RuO2 surfaces
<br>   with water has been confined largely to the ultrahigh vacuum environment
<br>   and to the thermodynamically stable (110) surface. In this work, we
<br>   combine ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ
<br>   surface diffraction, and density functional theory calculations to
<br>   investigate how four different facets of RuO2 interact with water under
<br>   humid and electrochemical environments. The vacant coordinatively

<br>   for -H2O and -OH and can allow for different degrees of hydrogen bonding
<br>   between the adsorbates. Consequently, the degree of water dissociation
<br>   is found to be sensitive to the surface crystallographic
<br>   orientation-being maximum for the (101) surface, followed by the (110),
<br>   (001) and (100) surfaces. This study identifies crystallographic
<br>   orientation as an important parameter to tune not only the density of

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Phase-change memory is one of the most attractive solutions for embedded
<br>   applications, thanks to the low cost of integration with current
<br>   manufacturing processes and the good scaling behavior. Despite intensive
<br>   research efforts that are devoted to the modification of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)
<br>   phase-change material, the obtained improvements are still
<br>   unsatisfactory for high-performance applications. In this paper,
<br>   SiC-modification is first introduced to enhance the amorphous stability
<br>   of GST without sacrificing its transition speed. Several enhancements
<br>   can be demonstrated, including better thermal stability (10-year data
<br>   retention above 120 degrees C), lower RESET voltage (about 3.0 V at 20
<br>   ns pulse width), reduced volume change (smaller than 3.0%), and
<br>   expected operation cycles (more than 1.0 x 10(5)). According to the
<br>   findings, the local bonding nature of Ge/Te atoms can be tuned by C/Si
<br>   dopants through forming CGe and SiTe bonds. Apart from strengthening the
<br>   atomic binding network for desirable data retention, the element
<br>   interdiffusion is also effectively controlled and suppressed. Together
<br>   with finer grains, smaller density change, and more uniform morphology,
<br>   the modified structure transition finally contributes to the reduced
<br>   switching voltage and long-term endurance. Hence, it is envisaged that
<br>   SiC-doped GST with such advantages will give a competitive option for
<br>   high-density and high-performance embedded memory.</td>

<br>   acts as a fluorine vapor source, was investigated by utilizing polyvinyl

<br>   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the reaction. The same process was

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) is an important material for
<br>   surface defect passivation of photovoltaic silicon (Si) wafers in order
<br>   to reduce their recombination losses. The material is, however, unstable
<br>   with regard to hydrogen (H) desorption at elevated temperatures, which
<br>   can be an issue during processing and device manufacturing. In this
<br>   work, we determine the temperature stability of a-Si:H by structural
<br>   characterization of a-Si:H/Si bilayers with neutron reflectometry and
<br>   X-ray reflectometry combined with photoconductance measurements,
<br>   yielding the minority carrier lifetime. The neutrons are sensitive to
<br>   light elements such as H, while the X-rays, which are insensitive to the
<br>   H concentration, provide an independent constraint on the layer
<br>   structure. It is shown that H desorption takes place at a temperature of
<br>   approximately T = 425 degrees C, and that the H content and minority
<br>   carrier lifetimes have a strongly correlated linear relationship, which
<br>   can be interpreted as one H atom passivating one defect.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Epitaxial films of the B20-structure compound Fe1-yCoyGe were grown by
<br>   molecular beam epitaxy on Si (111) substrates. The magnetization varied
<br>   smoothly from the bulklike values of one Bohr magneton per Fe atom for
<br>   FeGe to zero for nonmagnetic CoGe. The chiral lattice structure leads to
<br>   a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the films' helical
<br>   magnetic ground state was confirmed using polarized neutron
<br>   reflectometry measurements. The pitch of the spin helix, measured by
<br>   this method, varies with Co content y and diverges at y similar to 0.45.
<br>   This indicates a zero crossing of the DMI, which we reproduced in
<br>   calculations using first-principles methods. We also measured the
<br>   longitudinal and Hall resistivity of our films as a function of magnetic
<br>   field, temperature, and Co content y. The Hall resistivity is expected
<br>   to contain contributions from the ordinary, anomalous, and topological
<br>   Hall effects. Both the anomalous and topological Hall resistivities show
<br>   peaks around y similar to 0.5. Our first-principles calculations show a

<br>   experimentally observed linear magnetoresistance at this composition,
<br>   and potentially related to the other unusual transport properties for
<br>   intermediate value of y. While it is possible to reconcile theory with
<br>   experiment for the various Hall effects for FeGe, the large topological
<br>   Hall resistivities for y similar to 0.5 are much larger than expected
<br>   when the very small emergent fields associated with the divergence in

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic doping with transition metal ions is the most widely used
<br>   approach to break time-reversal symmetry in a topological insulator
<br>   (TI)-a prerequisite for unlocking the TI's exotic potential. Recently,
<br>   we reported the doping of Bi2Te3 thin films with rare-earth ions, which,
<br>   owing to their large magnetic moments, promise commensurately large
<br>   magnetic gap openings in the topological surface states. However, only
<br>   when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in angle-resolved
<br>   photoemission spectroscopy, which persists up to room temperature.
<br>   Although disorder alone could be ruled out as a cause of the topological
<br>   phase transition, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic and
<br>   electronic properties of Dy-doped Bi2Te3 remained elusive. Here, we
<br>   present an x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized neutron
<br>   reflectometry, muon-spin rotation, and resonant photoemission study of
<br>   the microscopic magnetic and electronic properties. We find that the
<br>   films are not simply paramagnetic but that instead the observed behavior
<br>   can be well explained by the assumption of slowly fluctuating,
<br>   inhomogeneous, magnetic patches with increasing volume fraction as the
<br>   temperature decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large effective
<br>   magnetization can be easily introduced by the application of moderate
<br>   magnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for
<br>   proximity coupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a
<br>   heterostructure with transition-metal-doped layers. However, the
<br>   introduction of some charge carriers by the Dy dopants cannot be
<br>   excluded at least in these highly doped samples. Nevertheless, we find
<br>   that the magnetic order is not mediated via the conduction channel in
<br>   these samples and therefore magnetic order and carrier concentration are
<br>   expected to be independently controllable. This is not generally the
<br>   case for transition-metal-doped topological insulators, and Dy doping
<br>   should thus allow for improved TI quantum devices.</td>

<br>   trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium-bis(mandelato)borate, [
<br>   P-6,P-6,P-6,P-14][BMB], has been studied at a gold electrode surface
<br>   in a polar solvent. For a 20% w/w IL mixture, contrast matched to the

<br>   of the bulk IL-solvent mixture. With applied potential, the amplitudes
<br>   of the fringes from the gold-boundary layer interface varied
<br>   systematically. These changes are attributable to the differing ratios
<br>   of cations and anions in the boundary layer, leading to a greater or
<br>   diminished contrast with the gold electrode, depending on the individual
<br>   ion scattering length densities. Such electro-responsive changes were
<br>   also evident in the reflectivities measured for the pure IL and a less
<br>   concentrated (5% w/w) IL-solvent mixture at the same applied
<br>   potentials, but gave rise to less pronounced changes. These
<br>   measurements, therefore, demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity achieved
<br>   by contrast matching the bulk solution and that the structure of the IL
<br>   boundary layers formed in mixtures is strongly influenced by the bulk
<br>   concentration. Together these results represent an important step in
<br>   characterising IL boundary layers in IL-solvent mixtures and provide

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: In the quest for materials with emergent or improved properties, an
<br>   effective route is to create artificial superstructures. Novel
<br>   properties emerge from the coupling between the phases, but the strength
<br>   of this coupling depends on the quality of the interfaces. Atomic
<br>   control of crystalline interfaces is notoriously complicated and to
<br>   elude that obstacle, we suggest here an all-amorphous design. Starting
<br>   from a model amorphous iron alloy, we locally tune the magnetic behavior
<br>   by creating boron-doped regions by means of ion implantation through a
<br>   lithographic mask. This process preserves the amorphous environment,
<br>   creating a non-topographic magnetic superstructure with smooth
<br>   interfaces and no structural discontinuities. The absence of
<br>   inhomogeneities acting as pinning centers for the magnetization reversal
<br>   is demonstrated by the formation of magnetic vortexes for ferromagnetic
<br>   disks as large as 20 mu m in diameter embedded within a paramagnetic
<br>   matrix. Rigid exchange coupling between two amorphous ferromagnetic
<br>   phases in a microstructured sample is evidenced by an investigation
<br>   involving first-order reversal curves. The sample consists of a soft
<br>   matrix with embedded elements constituting a hard phase where the
<br>   anisotropy originates from an elongated shape of the elements. We
<br>   provide an intuitive explanation for the micrometer-range exchange
<br>   coupling mechanism and discuss how to tailor the properties of
<br>   all-amorphous superstructures.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The multilayer structure of Fe/Si and Fe/Ge systems fabricated by ion
<br>   beam sputtering (IBS) was investigated using X-ray and polarized neutron
<br>   reflectivity measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy
<br>   with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The obtained result revealed that
<br>   the incorporation of sputtering gas particles (Ar) in the Ge layer gives
<br>   rise to a marked reduction in the neutron scattering length density
<br>   (SLD) and contributes to the SLD contrast between the Fe and Ge layers
<br>   almost vanishing for spin-down neutrons. Bundesmann et al. (2015) have
<br>   shown that the implantation of primary Ar ions backscattered at the
<br>   target is responsible for the incorporation of Ar particles and that the
<br>   fraction increases with increasing ion incidence angle and increasing
<br>   polar emission angle. This leads to a possibility of fine-tuning of the
<br>   SLD for the IBS, which is required to realize a high polarization
<br>   efficiency of a neutron polarizing supermirror. Fe/Ge polarizing
<br>   supermirror with m = 5 fabricated under the same condition showed a
<br>   spin-up reflectivity of 0.70 at the critical momentum transfer. The
<br>   polarization was higher than 0.985 for the q(2). range where the
<br>   correction for the polarization inefficiencies of the beamline works
<br>   properly. The result of the polarized neutron reflectivity measurement
<br>   suggests that the ``magnetically-dead'' layers formed at both sides of
<br>   the Fe layer, together with the SLD contrast, play a critical role in
<br>   determining the polarization performance of a polarizing supermirror.

<br>   dominated by parameters such as the crystal field potential, the

<br>   can thus qualitatively change the material, these values can hitherto
<br>   hardly be obtained with reasonable precision, be it theoretically or

<br>   artificial magnetic honeycomb lattice is a strongly debated issue. While
<br>   theoretical researches suggest that the system will develop a novel zero
<br>   entropy spin solid state as T -> 0 K, a confirmation to this effect in
<br>   artificial honeycomb lattice of connected elements is lacking. This
<br>   study reports on the investigation of magnetic correlation in newly
<br>   designed artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice of ultrasmall elements,
<br>   with a typical length of approximate to 12 nm, using neutron scattering
<br>   measurements and temperature-dependent micromagnetic simulations.
<br>   Numerical modeling of the polarized neutron reflectometry data
<br>   elucidates the temperature-dependent evolution of spin correlation in
<br>   this system. As temperature reduces to approximate to 7 K, the system
<br>   tends to develop novel spin solid state, manifested by the alternating
<br>   distribution of magnetic vortex loops of opposite chiralities.
<br>   Experimental results are complemented by temperature-dependent
<br>   micromagnetic simulations that confirm the dominance of spin solid state
<br>   over local magnetic charge ordered state in the artificial honeycomb
<br>   lattice with connected elements. These results enable a direct

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The atomic-scale structure of the interface between a transition metal
<br>   oxide and aqueous electrolyte regulates the interfacial chemical
<br>   reactions fundamental to (photo)electrochemical energy conversion and
<br>   electrode degradation. Measurements that probe oxide-electrolyte
<br>   interfaces in situ provide important details of ion and solvent
<br>   arrangements, but atomically precise structural models do not exist for
<br>   common oxide-electrolyte interfaces far from equilibrium. Using a novel
<br>   cell, the structure of the hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) (1 (1) over bar
<br>   02)-electrolyte interface is measured under controlled electrochemical
<br>   bias using synchrotron crystal truncation rod X-ray scattering. At
<br>   increasingly cathodic potentials, charge-compensating protonation of
<br>   surface oxygen groups increases the coverage of specifically bound water
<br>   while adjacent water layers displace outwardly and became disordered.
<br>   Returning to open circuit potential leaves the surface in a persistent
<br>   metastable state. Therefore, the flux of current and ions across the
<br>   interface is regulated by multiple electrolyte layers whose specific
<br>   structure and polarization change in response to the applied potential.
<br>   The study reveals the complex environment underlying the simplified
<br>   electrical double layer models used to interpret electrochemical
<br>   measurements and emphasizes the importance of condition-specific
<br>   structural characterization for properly understanding catalytic
<br>   processes at functional transition metal oxide-electrolyte interfaces.</td>

<br>   can be seen with transmission electron microscopy down to n = 4 ML layer
<br>   thickness, although an intermixed region characterized by a finite

<br>   interface roughness as well as the interdiffusion between layers, but
<br>   the relative contributions from these two sources could not be concluded
<br>   by the techniques used. The measured elemental layering and X-ray
<br>   reflectivity (XRR) give an upper limit to the interface width which must
<br>   be smaller than the thinnest layers, 4 ML. Electron energy loss
<br>   spectroscopy (EELS), depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
<br>   (XPS) and also XRR reveal that Fe has a higher tendency to mix with Ni
<br>   than vice versa. XPS does not have the resolution to measure this thin
<br>   elemental layering: composition variations for n = 8 ML which are
<br>   clearly seen by EELS are barely resolved by XPS. The structure was

<br>   changing from (001) to (111) orientation along the growth direction. A

<br>   at high temperature onto (001)-MgO or (0001)-Al2O3 substrates and capped

<br>   well as precursors, was investigated by using TDTR method. This layer
<br>   was studied by its thermal transients in the (sub-)nanosecond time range
<br>   at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 500 degrees C.
<br>   In this paper, these thermal transients of the Nb2O5 layer were analysed
<br>   by three evaluation approaches: One analytical and two numerical
<br>   approaches, the relative thermal resistance method and the structure
<br>   function method. The analytical approach revealed that its thermal
<br>   diffusivity and thermal conductivity increases with rising temperature
<br>   from (0.43 to 0.74) mm(2)/s and from (1.0 to 2.3) W/mK. The numerical
<br>   approaches enables to get rid of certain up-front assumptions, which are
<br>   necessary when applying analytical solution and enables deeper
<br>   understanding of the Nb2O5 thermal behaviour.</td>

<br>   environmental cleanup. Its chemical and mechanical stability are
<br>   intricately linked to the concentration of interstitial O atoms within
<br>   the structure and the oxidation state of U. We have previously shown
<br>   that, during corrosion of the UO2 (111) surface under either 1 atm of
<br>   O-2 gas or oxygenated water at room temperature, oxygen interstitials
<br>   diffuse into the substrate to form a superlattice with three-layer
<br>   periodicity. In the current study, we present results from surface X-ray
<br>   scattering that reveal the structure of the oxygen diffusion profile
<br>   beneath the (001) surface. The first few layers below the surface
<br>   oscillate strongly in their surface -normal lattice parameters,
<br>   suggesting preferential interstitial occupation of every other layer
<br>   below the surface, which is geometrically consistent with the
<br>   interstitial network that forms below the oxidized (111) surface. Deeper
<br>   layers are heavily contracted and indicate that the oxidation front
<br>   penetrates similar to 52 angstrom below the (001) surface after 21 days
<br>   of dry O-2 gas exposure at ambient pressure and temperature. X-ray
<br>   photoelectron spectroscopy indicates U is present as U(IV), U(V), and
<br>   U(VI).</td>

<br>   Here, we unlock a host of unique, hidden electronic and magnetic phase
<br>   transitions in NdNiO3 while approaching the two-dimensional (2D) limit,
<br>   resulting from the differing influences of dimensional confinement and
<br>   interfacial coupling. Most notably, we discover a phase in fully 2D,
<br>   single-layer NdNiO3, in which all signatures of the bulk magnetic and
<br>   charge ordering are found to vanish. In addition, for
<br>   quasi-two-dimensional layers down to a thickness of two unit cells,
<br>   bulk-type ordering persists but separates from the onset of insulating
<br>   behavior in a manner distinct from that found in the bulk or thin-film
<br>   nickelates. Using resonant x-ray spectroscopies, first-principles
<br>   theory, and model calculations, we propose that the single-layer phase
<br>   suppression results from an alternative mechanism of interfacial
<br>   electronic reconstruction based on ionicity differences across the
<br>   interface, while the phase separation in multilayer NdNiO3 emerges due
<br>   to enhanced 2D fluctuations. These findings provide insights into the
<br>   intertwined mechanisms of charge and spin ordering in strongly
<br>   correlated systems in reduced dimensions and illustrate the ability to
<br>   use atomic layering to access hidden phases.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Understanding the magnetism at the interface between a ferromagnet and

<br>   layer close to an interface can be problematic in magnetic tunnel
<br>   junctions. Previously, degradation of the magnetic interface was
<br>   attributed to charge discontinuity across the interface. Here, the
<br>   interfacial magnetism was investigated using three identically prepared
<br>   La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) thin films grown on different oriented SrTiO3
<br>   (STO) substrates by polarized neutron reflectometry. In all cases the

<br>   show that the interfacial magnetization is largest across the LSMO/STO
<br>   interfaces with (001) and (111) orientations, which have the largest net
<br>   charge discontinuities across the interfaces. In contrast, the
<br>   magnetization of LSMO/STO across the (110) interface, the orientation
<br>   with no net charge discontinuity, is the smallest of the three
<br>   orientations. We show that a magnetically degraded interface is not
<br>   intrinsic to LSMO/STO heterostructures. The approach to use different
<br>   crystallographic orientations provides a means to investigate the
<br>   influence of charge discontinuity on the interfacial magnetization.</td>

<br>   demonstrated to be a suitable process for growing compound
<br>   semiconductors, by alternating the under-potential deposition (UPD) of
<br>   the metallic element with the UPD of the non-metallic element. The cycle
<br>   can be repeated several times to build up films with sub-micrometric
<br>   thickness. We show that it is possible to grow, by E-ALD, Cu2S
<br>   ultra-thin films on Ag(111) with high structural quality. They show a
<br>   well ordered layered crystal structure made on alternating
<br>   pseudohexagonal layers in lower coordination. As reported in literature
<br>   for minerals in the Cu-S compositional field, these are based on CuS3
<br>   triangular groups, with layers occupied by highly mobile Cu ions. This
<br>   structural model is closely related to the one of the low chalcocite.
<br>   The domain size of such films is more than 1000 angstrom in lateral size
<br>   and extends with a high crystallinity in the vertical growth direction
<br>   up to more than 10 nm. E-ALD process results in the growth of highly

<br>   the design of semiconductors with optimal transport proprieties by an

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The scientific and technological interest for metal-dielectric
<br>   nanocomposite thin films emanates from the excitation of localized
<br>   surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) on the metal component. The overall
<br>   optical response of the nanocomposite is governed by the refractive
<br>   index of the dielectric matrix and the properties of the metallic
<br>   nanoparticles in terms of their bulk optical properties, size, and
<br>   shape, and the inter-particle distance of separation. In order to tune
<br>   the film morphology and optical properties, complex synthesis processes
<br>   which include multiple steps-i. e., film deposition followed by
<br>   post-deposition treatment by thermal or laser annealing-are commonly
<br>   employed. In the present study, we demonstrate that the absorption
<br>   resonances of Ag/AlOxNy nanocomposite films can be effectively tuned
<br>   from green (similar to 2.4 eV) to violet (similar to 2.8 eV) using a
<br>   single-step synthesis process that is based on modulating the arrival
<br>   pattern of film forming species with sub-monolayer resolution, while
<br>   keeping the amount of Ag in the films constant. Our data indicate that
<br>   the optical response of the films is the result of LSPRs on isolated Ag
<br>   nanoparticles that are seemingly shifted by dipolar interactions between
<br>   neighboring particles. The synthesis strategy presented may be of
<br>   relevance for enabling integration of plasmonic nanocomposite films on
<br>   thermally sensitive substrates. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Tritium betavoltaics are one of the family of nuclear batteries which
<br>   convert natural radioactive decay from a radioisotope into electricity
<br>   that can provide continuous power without the requirement for
<br>   replacement or recharging. Tritium is ideally suited to this application
<br>   due to its high specific activity, low shielding requirements and
<br>   relatively high availability. Owing to safety and environmental concerns
<br>   over tritium leakage, metal tritides films are preferred as tritium
<br>   betavoltaic sources. Titanium hydride and deuteride films were studied
<br>   as analogues to titanium tritide films. The quality of the films
<br>   depended on the temperature of hydrogen loading as films loaded at
<br>   elevated temperatures (>100 degrees C) were brittle and delaminated from
<br>   the semiconductor substrate while those exposed to hydrogen at room
<br>   temperature continued to adhere to the substrate. For the latter films,
<br>   evidence of hydrogen isotope loss was observed when left under ambient
<br>   conditions over the course of a few weeks.</td>

<br>   layers has been studied by in vacuo high-sensitivity low energy ion
<br>   scattering for two gas deposition conditions with different oxygen
<br>   contents (high-O and low-O conditions). This unique surface sensitive
<br>   technique allowed the determination of surface composition and
<br>   thicknesses required to close the ZrO2 layer on all three substrates for
<br>   both conditions. The ZrO2 layer closes similarly on all substrates due
<br>   to more favorable enthalpies of formation for ZrO2 and ZrSiO4, resulting
<br>   in passivation of the Si from the substrate. However, this layer closes
<br>   at about half of the thickness (similar to 1.7 nm) for low-O conditions
<br>   due to less oxidative conditions and less energetic particles arriving
<br>   at the sample, which leads to less intermixing via silicate formation.
<br>   In contrast, for high-O conditions, there is more ZrSiO4 and/or SiOx
<br>   formation, giving more intermixing (similar to 3.4 nm). In vacuo X-ray
<br>   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed similar
<br>   stoichiometric ZrO2 layers deposited by both conditions and a higher
<br>   interaction of the ZrO2 layer with the underlying a-Si for high-O
<br>   conditions. In addition, oxygen diffusion through low-O ZrO2 films on
<br>   a-Si has been investigated by ex situ angular-resolved XPS of samples
<br>   annealed in atmospheric oxygen. For temperatures below 400 degrees C, no
<br>   additional oxidation of the underlying a-Si was observed. This, together
<br>   with the amorphous nature and smoothness of these samples, makes ZrO2 a
<br>   good candidate as an oxidation protective layer on top of a-Si.

<br>   interfaces within electronic materials strongly influences the
<br>   functional electronic and vibrational properties relevant to
<br>   applications ranging from energy storage to photovoltaics. Controlling
<br>   and characterizing the structural state of an interface and its
<br>   evolution under external stimuli is crucial both for the fundamental
<br>   understanding of the factors influenced by molecular structure and for
<br>   the development of methods for material synthesis. It has been
<br>   challenging to create complete molecular monolayers that exhibit
<br>   external reversible control of the structure and electronic
<br>   configuration. We report a monolayer/inorganic interface consisting of
<br>   an organic monolayer assembled on an oxide surface, exhibiting
<br>   structural and electronic reconfiguration under ultraviolet
<br>   illumination. The molecular monolayer is linked to the surface through a
<br>   carboxylate link, with the backbone bearing an azobenzene functional
<br>   group and the head group consisting bipyridine group. Optical
<br>   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,
<br>   and X-ray reflectivity show that closely packed monolayers are formed
<br>   from these molecules via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Reversible
<br>   photoisomerization is observed in solution and in monolayers assembled
<br>   on Si and quartz substrates. The reconfiguration of these monolayers
<br>   provides additional means to control excitation and charge transfer
<br>   processes that are important in applications in catalysis, molecular

<br>   The evolution of microstructure and chemical bonds as a function of

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The interaction of water with metal oxide surfaces plays a crucial role
<br>   in the catalytic and geochemical behavior of metal oxides. In a vast
<br>   majority of studies, the interfacial structure is assumed to arise from
<br>   a relatively static lowest energy configuration of atoms, even at room
<br>   temperature. Using hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as a model oxide, we show
<br>   through a direct comparison of in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering with
<br>   density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations that the
<br>   structure of the (1 (1) over bar 02) termination is dynamically
<br>   stabilized by picosecond water exchange. Simulations show frequent
<br>   exchanges between terminal aquo groups and adsorbed water in locations
<br>   and with partial residence times consistent with experimentally
<br>   determined atomic sites and fractional occupancies. Frequent water
<br>   exchange occurs even for an ultrathin adsorbed water film persisting on
<br>   the surface under a dry atmosphere. The resulting time averaged
<br>   interfacial structure consists of a ridged lateral arrangement of
<br>   adsorbed water molecules hydrogen bonded to terminal aquo groups.
<br>   Surface pK(a) prediction based on bond valence analysis suggests that
<br>   water exchange will influence the proton-transfer reactions underlying
<br>   the acid/base reactivity at the interface. Our findings provide

<br>   that deteriorates electron beam quality, significant effort has been
<br>   made to explore novel growth methods for K2CsSb photocathodes. In this
<br>   paper, a method of ternary co-evaporation of K, Cs, and Sb is described.
<br>   By using in-situ synchrotron X-ray techniques, the quality of the
<br>   photocathode is characterized during and after the growth. K2CsSb
<br>   photocathodes grown by this method on Si (100) and MgO (001) substrates
<br>   show strong (222) texture, and the two photocathodes exhibit 1.7% and
<br>   3.4% quantum efficiencies at a wavelength of 530 nm, with a rms surface
<br>   roughness of about 2-4 nm. This represents an order of magnitude
<br>   reduction in roughness compared to typical sequential deposition and
<br>   should result in a significant improvement in the brightness of the
<br>   generated electron beam. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

<br>   was investigated, focusing on molecular level behavior of the reactants

<br>   with synchrotron radiation were applied in situ. The change in
<br>   reflectivity of the electrode surface during the deposition was found to
<br>   be due to the formation of a polymer-like Si such as Si2Cl6, which is an
<br>   intermediate layer during the deposition process. These results were
<br>   theoretically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations:
<br>   after an electron transfers from the electrode, the Si in SiCl4 forms
<br>   the bond with another SiCl4, rather than the Si of the substrate,
<br>   resulting in the formation of the intermediate structure. These data
<br>   suggest an elementary step in the SiCl4 reduction process which can be
<br>   described as follows; when SiCl4 is reduced, a polymer-like Si form such
<br>   as Si2Cl6 is generated. This intermediate species further reacts with
<br>   other Si reactants after receiving additional electrons, which then
<br>   finally deposits as Si on the substrate. (c) The Author(s) 2017.

<br>   thickness and B2 ordering can form structurally abrupt interface with
<br>   Ge(111). Atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Cerium oxide, or ceria, is an important material for solid oxide fuel
<br>   cells and water splitting devices. Although the ceria surface is active
<br>   in catalytic and electrochemical reactions, how its catalytic properties
<br>   are affected by the surface structure under operating conditions is far
<br>   from understood. We investigate the structure of the coherently strained
<br>   CeO2 ultrathin films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (001) single crystals
<br>   by specular synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) under oxidizing
<br>   conditions as a first step to study the surface structure in situ. An
<br>   excellent agreement between the experiment data and the model is
<br>   achieved by using a ``stacks and islands'' model that has a
<br>   two-component roughness. One component is due to the tiny clusters of
<br>   nanometer scale in lateral dimensions on each terrace, while the other
<br>   component is due to slightly different CeO2 thickness that span over
<br>   hundreds of nanometers on neighboring terraces. We attribute the
<br>   nonuniform thickness to step depairing during the thin film deposition
<br>   that is supported by the surface morphology results on the microscopic
<br>   level. Importantly, our model also shows that the polarity of the ceria
<br>   surface is removed by a half monolayer surface coverage of oxygen. The
<br>   successful resolution of the ceria surface structure using in situ
<br>   specular synchrotron XRD paves the way to study the structural evolution
<br>   of ceria as a fuel cell electrode under catalytically relevant

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: It has recently been demonstrated that nanoscale molecular films can
<br>   spontaneously assemble to self-generate intrinsic electric fields that
<br>   can exceed 10(8) V/m. These electric fields originate from polarization
<br>   charges in the material that arise because the films self-assemble to
<br>   orient molecular dipole moments. This has been called the spontelectric
<br>   effect. Such growth of spontaneously polarized layers of molecular
<br>   solids has implications for our understanding of how intermolecular
<br>   interactions dictate the structure of molecular materials used in a
<br>   range of applications, for example, molecular semiconductors, sensors,
<br>   and catalysts. Here we present the first in situ structural
<br>   characterization of a representative spontelectric solid, nitrous oxide.
<br>   Infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and neutron
<br>   reflectivity measurements demonstrate that polarized films of nitrous
<br>   oxide undergo a structural phase transformation upon heating above 48 K
<br>   A mean-field model can be used to describe quantitatively the magnitude
<br>   of the spontaneously generated field as a function of film-growth
<br>   temperature, and this model also recreates the phase change. This
<br>   reinforces the spontelectric model as a means of describing long-range

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: X-ray reflectivity is a promising technique for characterizing buried
<br>   layers and interfaces in ultrathin films because of its ability to probe
<br>   the electron density profile along the depth in a non-destructive
<br>   manner. While routine X-ray reflectivity assumes the in-plane uniformity
<br>   of the sample to be measured, it is also quite important to see buried
<br>   inhomogeneous/patterned layers and interfaces. The present paper
<br>   describes the addition of spatial resolution and imaging capability to
<br>   an X-ray reflectivity technique to visualize surfaces and buried
<br>   interfaces. To visualize quite wide viewing area size quickly, the image
<br>   reconstruction scheme has been employed instead of the scanning of
<br>   microbeam. Though the mathematics is quite close to X-ray computer
<br>   tomography, the technique gives the image contrast caused by the
<br>   difference in reflectivity at each in-plane point in the thin film
<br>   sample. By choosing a grazing angle, the image gives inhomogeneity of
<br>   X-ray reflectivity at the specific wavevector transfer. With a
<br>   collimated monochromatic synchrotron X-ray beam of 0.05mm (H) x 8mm (V),
<br>   the intensity profiles of X-ray reflection projections have been taken
<br>   at many different in-plane rotation angles, from 0 degrees to 180
<br>   degrees. We have succeeded in visualizing buried layers and interfaces
<br>   of the 8mm dia area with the spatial resolution of better than 20 mu m.
<br>   Because of the brilliance of synchrotron radiation, the typical
<br>   measuring time is shorter than 1min. Three analytical cases have been
<br>   discussed: (i) imaging of a buried layer and an interface covered by a
<br>   protection layer, (ii) distinguishing different local parts of different
<br>   thicknesses in an ultrathin film, and (iii) selective imaging of a
<br>   specific metal in the thin film form. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: SrTiO3 is not only of enduring interest due to its unique dielectric,
<br>   structural, and lattice dynamical properties, but is also the archetypal
<br>   perovskite oxide semiconductor and a foundational material in oxide
<br>   heterostructures and electronics. This has naturally focused attention
<br>   on growth, stoichiometry, and defects in SrTiO3, one exciting recent
<br>   development being such precisely stoichiometric defect-managed thin
<br>   films that electron mobilities have finally exceeded bulk crystals. This
<br>   has been achieved only by molecular beam epitaxy, however (and to a
<br>   somewhat lesser extent pulsed laser deposition (PLD)), and numerous open
<br>   questions remain. Here, we present a study of the stoichiometry,
<br>   defects, and structure in SrTiO3 synthesized by a different method, high
<br>   pressure oxygen sputtering, relating the results to electronic
<br>   transport. We find that this form of sputter deposition is also capable
<br>   of homoepitaxy of precisely stoichiometric SrTiO3, but only provided
<br>   that substrate and target preparation, temperature, pressure, and
<br>   deposition rate are carefully controlled. Even under these conditions,
<br>   oxygen-vacancy-doped heteroepitaxial SrTiO3 films are found to have
<br>   carrier density, mobility, and conductivity significantly lower than
<br>   bulk. While surface depletion plays a role, it is argued from
<br>   particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) measurements of trace impurities
<br>   in commercial sputtering targets that this is also due to deep acceptors
<br>   such as Fe at 100's of parts-per-million levels. Comparisons of PIXE
<br>   from SrTiO3 crystals and polycrystalline targets are shown to be of
<br>   general interest, with clear implications for sputter and PLD deposition
<br>   of this important material. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

<br>   demonstrating the retention both of the austenitic phase and of the

<br>   at low concentrations, with maximum protein concentration a distance of
<br>   around 20 A from the surface. Evidence for a further diffuse
<br>   reversibly-bound layer forming at higher concentrations was also
<br>   observed. Both the structure of the layer revealed by the neutron

<br>   data suggest that there is a significant extent of protein unfolding
<br>   upon adsorption. A lower extent of adsorption was seen on the chromium

<br>   To overcome this limitation we have created artificial spin structures
<br>   by heteroepitaxy between two bulk antiferromagnets SrMnO3 and NdMnO3.
<br>   Here, we demonstrate that charge transfer at the interface results in
<br>   the creation of thin ferromagnetic layers adjacent to A-type

<br>   heterostructures of sputtered MoS2 on boron nitride (BN) deposited on
<br>   (001)-oriented Si substrates. The steady state photocurrent (I-ph)
<br>   measurements used a continuous laser of lambda = 658 nm (E = 1.88 eV)
<br>   over a broad range of laser intensities, P (similar to 1 mu W < P < 10
<br>   mu W), and indicate that I-ph obtained from MoS2 layers with the 80 nm
<br>   BN under layer was similar to 4 times higher than that obtained from
<br>   MoS2 layers with the 30 nm BN under layer. We also found super linear
<br>   dependence of I-ph on P (Iph proportional to P-gamma, with gamma > 1) in
<br>   both the samples. The responsivities obtained over the range of laser
<br>   intensity studied were in the order of mA/W (similar to 12 and similar
<br>   to 2.7 mA/W with 80 nm BN and 30 nm BN under layers, respectively).
<br>   These investigations provide crucial insight into the optical activity
<br>   of MoS2 on BN, which could be useful for developing a variety of

<br>   dichalcogenide heterostructures.</td>

<br>   substantially smaller than the diameter of the container, such that
<br>   reflection takes place only from the flat region of the liquid surface
<br>   thus excluding the meniscus tails. Practical measures for minimizing the

<br>   to the different localized spin-orbit interaction related to intermixing
<br>   and to alpha hybridization of Pt and Au at the interface with Co or
<br>   Ni81Fe19. Also it was shown that damping is affected by the crystal
<br>   structure differences in FM thin films and at the interface, which can
<br>   modify the spin-diffusion length and the effective spin-mixing
<br>   conductance. In addition to the intrinsic damping an extrinsic

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Perovskite oxides are a promising material class for photovoltaic and

<br>   recombination lifetimes, and great chemical diversity. However, there is
<br>   limited understanding of the link between composition and static and
<br>   dynamic optical properties, despite the critical role these properties
<br>   play in the design of light-harvesting devices. To clarify these
<br>   relationships, we systemically studied the optoelectronic properties in
<br>   La1-xSrxFeO3-delta epitaxial films, uncovering the effects of A-site
<br>   cation substitution and oxygen stoichiometry. Variable-angle
<br>   spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure static optical
<br>   properties, revealing a linear increase in absorption coefficient at
<br>   1.25 eV and a red-shifting of the optical absorption edge with
<br>   increasing Sr fraction. The absorption spectra can be similarly tuned
<br>   through the introduction of oxygen vacancies, indicating the critical
<br>   role that nominal Fe valence plays in optical absorption. Dynamic
<br>   optoelectronic properties were studied with ultrafast transient
<br>   reflectance spectroscopy, revealing similar nanosecond photoexcited
<br>   carrier lifetimes for oxygen deficient and stoichiometric films with the
<br>   same nominal Fe valence. These results demonstrate that while the static
<br>   optical absorption is strongly dependent on nominal Fe valence tuned
<br>   through cation or anion stoichiometry, oxygen vacancies do not appear to
<br>   play a significantly detrimental role in the recombination kinetics.</td>

<br>   on the molecular level and the formation of mixed structures. However,
<br>   due to the strongly different interactions in both mixtures the ordering
<br>   is fundamentally different. For the equimolar PFP:PIC mixtures, we
<br>   observe the formation of two different mixed polymorphs with unit cells
<br>   containing 2 PIC and 2 PFP molecules depending on the growth
<br>   temperature. One of these polymorphs is a superlattice with in-plane
<br>   compound segregation. The other polymorph is less symmetric and results
<br>   only in a very short ranged in-plane ordering. In contrast, the PEN:PIC
<br>   mixtures form crystals with unit cell parameters continuously changing
<br>   with the molar concentrations between those of the pure compounds. The
<br>   position of molecular species within the crystal lattice is statistical.
<br>   Surprisingly, for higher concentrations of PIC we observe phase
<br>   separation of surplus PIC molecules which corresponds to a limited
<br>   intermixing of the two compounds. Finally, the results are discussed in
<br>   the context of other organic semiconductor binary mixtures showing that

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Owing to its high room-temperature electron mobility and wide bandgap,
<br>   BaSnO3 has recently become of significant interest for potential
<br>   room-temperature oxide electronics. A hybrid molecular beam epitaxy
<br>   (MBE) approach for the growth of high-quality BaSnO3 films is developed
<br>   in this work. This approach employs hexamethylditin as a chemical
<br>   precursor for tin, an effusion cell for barium, and a radio frequency
<br>   plasma source for oxygen. BaSnO3 films were thus grown on SrTiO3 (001)
<br>   and LaAlO3 (001) substrates. Growth conditions for stoichiometric BaSnO3
<br>   were identified. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
<br>   intensity oscillations, characteristic of a layer-by-layer growth mode
<br>   were observed. A critical thickness of similar to 1 nm for strain
<br>   relaxation was determined for films grown on SrTiO3 using in situ RHEED.
<br>   Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron
<br>   energy-loss spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
<br>   confirmed the cube-on-cube epitaxy and composition. The importance of
<br>   precursor chemistry is discussed in the context of the MBE growth of
<br>   BaSnO3. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.</td>

<br>   (25-60 degrees C) at 97% relative humidity by neutron reflectometry.
<br>   This is the first report on the behavior of thin Nafion films at
<br>   elevated temperatures and high humidity. Large hysteresis is observed
<br>   during the temperature cycle. The observed swelling strain in the film
<br>   at 60 degrees C is 48% as compared to the as-deposited state, which is
<br>   far above any previously observed trend at room temperature. A small
<br>   decrease in the average SLD suggests that part of the additional
<br>   swelling is due to thermal expansion, but the estimated D2O/SO3 ratio
<br>   also increases by 70%. Half of the ``excess'' absorption and 73% of
<br>   the additional swelling are retained during cooling back to room
<br>   temperature. The results provide new insights into the dynamics of
<br>   Nafion on nanometer scales under fuel cell operating conditions.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Phase-change memory (PCM) has great potential for numerous attractive
<br>   applications on the premise of its high-device performances, which still
<br>   need to be improved by employing a material with good overall
<br>   phase-change properties. In respect to fast speed and high endurance,
<br>   the Ti-Sb-Te alloy seems to be a promising candidate. Here, Ti-doped
<br>   Sb2Te3 (TST) materials with different Ti concentrations have been
<br>   systematically studied with the goal of finding the most suitable
<br>   composition for PCM applications. The thermal stability of TST is
<br>   improved dramatically with increasing Ti content. The small density
<br>   change of T0.32Sb2Te3 (2.24%), further reduced to 1.37% for
<br>   T0.56Sb2Te3, would greatly avoid the voids generated at phase-change
<br>   layer/electrode interface in a PCM device. Meanwhile, the exponentially
<br>   diminished grain size (from similar to 200 nm to similar to 12 nm),
<br>   resulting from doping more and more Ti, enhances the adhesion between
<br>   phase-change film and substrate. Tests of TST-based PCM cells have
<br>   demonstrated a fast switching rate of similar to 10 ns. Furthermore,
<br>   because of the lower thermal conductivities of TST materials, compared
<br>   with Sb2Te3-based PCM cells, T0.32Sb2Te3-based ones exhibit lower
<br>   required pulse voltages for Reset operation, which largely decreases by
<br>   similar to 50% for T0.43Sb2Te3-based ones. Nevertheless, the operation
<br>   voltages for T0.56Sb2Te3-based cells dramatically increase, which may be
<br>   due to the phase separation after doping excessive Ti. Finally,
<br>   considering the decreased resistance ratio, TixSb2Te3 alloy with x
<br>   around 0.43 is proved to be a highly promising candidate for fast and
<br>   long-life PCM applications.</td>

<br>   antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition that is first order. It
<br>   thus shows phase coexistence, usually by proceeding though nucleation at
<br>   random defect sites followed by propagation of phase boundary domain
<br>   walls. The transition occurs at a temperature that can be varied by
<br>   doping other metals onto the Rh site. We have taken advantage of this to
<br>   yield control over the transition process by preparing an epilayer with
<br>   oppositely directed doping gradients of Pd and Ir throughout its height,
<br>   yielding a gradual transition that occurs between 350 K and 500 K. As
<br>   the sample is heated, a horizontal antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase
<br>   boundary domain wall moves gradually up through the layer, its position
<br>   controlled by the temperature. This mobile magnetic domain wall affects
<br>   the magnetisation and resistivity of the layer in a way that can be

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: A basic understanding of biological membranes is of paramount importance
<br>   as these membranes comprise the very building blocks of life itself.
<br>   Cells depend in their function on a range of properties of the membrane,
<br>   which are important for the stability and function of the cell,
<br>   information and nutrient transport, waste disposal, and finally the
<br>   admission of drugs into the cell and also the deflection of bacteria and
<br>   viruses. We have investigated the influence of ibuprofen on the
<br>   structure and dynamics of L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (SoyPC) membranes
<br>   by means of grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering, neutron
<br>   reflectometry, and grazing incidence neutron spin echo spectroscopy.
<br>   From the results of these experiments, we were able to determine that
<br>   ibuprofen induces a two-step structuring behavior in the SoyPC films,
<br>   where the structure evolves from the purely lamellar phase for pure
<br>   SoyPC over a superposition of two hexagonal phases to a purely hexagonal
<br>   phase at high concentrations. A relaxation, which is visible when no
<br>   ibuprofen is present in the membrane, vanishes upon addition of
<br>   ibuprofen. This we attribute to a stiffening of the membrane. This
<br>   behavior may be instrumental in explaining the toxic behavior of
<br>   ibuprofen in long-term application.</td>

<br>   Pbn+1(Ti1-xFex)(n)O3n+1-delta forms spontaneously during pulsed laser
<br>   deposition of PTFO on LaAlO3 substrates. High-resolution transmission

<br>   spectroscopy were utilised to perform a structural and compositional
<br>   analysis, demonstrating that n similar or equal to 8 and x similar or
<br>   equal to 0.5. The complex dielectric function of the films was
<br>   determined from far-infrared to ultraviolet energies using a combination
<br>   of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, Fourier transform spectroscopy,
<br>   and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The simultaneous Raman and infrared
<br>   activity of phonon modes and the observation of second harmonic
<br>   generation establishes a non-centrosymmetric point group for
<br>   Pbn+1(Ti1-xFex)(n)O3n+1-delta, a prerequisite for (but not proof of)
<br>   ferroelectricity. No evidence of macroscopic ferromagnetism was found in
<br>   SQUID magnetometry. The ultrafast optical response exhibited coherent
<br>   magnon oscillations compatible with local magnetic order, and
<br>   additionally was used to study photocarrier cooling on picosecond
<br>   timescales. An optical gap smaller than that of BiFeO3 and long

<br>   In contrast to methods using strain or confinement, this orbital tuning
<br>   is achieved by exploiting charge transfer and inversion symmetry
<br>   breaking using atomically layered heterostructures. We illustrate the
<br>   technique in the LaTiO3-LaNiO3-LaAlO3 system; a combination of x-ray
<br>   absorption spectroscopy and ab initio theory reveals electron transfer
<br>   and concomitant polar fields, resulting in a similar to 50% change in

<br>   remove the orbital degeneracy of bulk LaNiO3 and creates an electronic
<br>   configuration approaching a single-band Fermi surface. Furthermore, we
<br>   theoretically show that such three-component heterostructuring is robust
<br>   and tunable by choice of insulator in the heterostructure, providing a

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Nanoconfined magnesium hydride can be simultaneously protected and
<br>   thermodynamically destabilized when interfaced with materials such as Ti
<br>   and Fe. We study the hydrogenation of thin layers of Mg (<14 nm)
<br>   nanoconfined in one dimension within thin film Fe/Mg/Fe/Pd multilayers
<br>   by the optical technique Hydrogenography. The hydrogenation of nanosized
<br>   magnesium layers in Fe/Mg/Fe multilayers surprisingly shows the presence
<br>   of multiple plateau pressures, whose nature is thickness dependent. In
<br>   contrast, hydrogen desorption occurs via a single plateau which does not
<br>   depend on the Mg layer thickness. From structural and morphological
<br>   analyses with X-ray diffraction/reflectometry and cross-section TEM, we
<br>   find that the Mg layer roughness is large when deposited on Fe and
<br>   furthermore contains high-angle grain boundaries (GB's). When grown on
<br>   Ti, the Mg layer roughness is low and no high-angle GB's are detected.
<br>   From a Ti/Mg/Fe multilayer, in which the Mg layer is flat and has little
<br>   or no GB's, we conclude that MgH2 is indeed destabilized by the
<br>   interface with Fe. In this case, both the ab- and desorption plateau
<br>   pressures are increased by a factor two compared to the hydrogenation of
<br>   Mg within Ti/Mg/Ti multilayers. We hypothesize that the GB's in the
<br>   Fe/Mg/Fe multilayer act as diffusion pathways for Pd, which is known to
<br>   greatly alter the hydrogenation behavior of Mg when the two materials
<br>   share an interface. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The contact between a molecule and a metallic electrode contributes to
<br>   or even determines the characteristics of organic devices, such as their

<br>   takes place when two materials with different chemical potentials are
<br>   put together. In the case of magnetic electrodes, the transfer can be
<br>   accompanied by the transmission of a net spin polarization or spin
<br>   doping. In nanocarbon systems, hybridization and spin doping can
<br>   suppress the moment of a transition metal ferromagnet through the loss

<br>   on ( 001)-oriented LaSrAlO4 substrates have been grown with pulsed laser
<br>   deposition technique. Their structural, magnetic, and superconducting
<br>   properties have been determined with in situ reflection high-energy
<br>   electron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, specular neutron reflectometry,
<br>   scanning transmission electron microscopy, electric transport, and
<br>   magnetization measurements. We find that despite the large mismatch
<br>   between the in-plane lattice parameters of LSCO (a = 0.3779 nm) and LCMO
<br>   (a = 0.387 nm) these superlattices can be grown epitaxially and with a
<br>   high crystalline quality. While the first LSCO layer remains clamped to
<br>   the LaSrAlO4 substrate, a sizable strain relaxation occurs already in
<br>   the first LCMO layer. The following LSCO and LCMO layers adopt a nearly
<br>   balanced state in which the tensile and compressive strain effects yield
<br>   alternating in-plane lattice parameters with an almost constant average
<br>   value. No major defects are observed in the LSCO layers, while a
<br>   significant number of vertical antiphase boundaries are found in the
<br>   LCMOlayers. The LSCO layers remain superconducting with a relatively
<br>   high superconducting onset temperature of T onset c approximate to 36 K.
<br>   The macroscopic superconducting response is also evident in the
<br>   magnetization data due to a weak diamagnetic signal below 10 K for H
<br>   parallel to ab and a sizable paramagnetic shift for H parallel to c that
<br>   can be explained in terms of a vortex-pinning-induced flux compression.
<br>   The LCMO layers maintain a strongly ferromagnetic state with a Curie
<br>   temperature of T Curie approximate to 190 K and a large low-temperature
<br>   saturation moment of about 3.5(1) mu(B) per Mn ion. These results
<br>   suggest that the LSCO/ LCMO superlattices can be used to study the
<br>   interaction between the antagonistic ferromagnetic and superconducting
<br>   orders and, in combination with previous studies on YBa2Cu3O7-x/ La2/
<br>   3Ca1/ 3MnO3 superlattices, may allow one to identify the relevant

<br>   intermolecular interactions and steric incompatibilities due to the size
<br>   mismatch of perfluoropentacene (PFP) and diindenoperylene (DIP) on the
<br>   structure formation and associated optical properties in mixed films.
<br>   Using real-time grazing incidence X-ray diffraction we investigate the
<br>   size of coherently scattering islands l(s) as a function of film
<br>   thickness and mixing ratio. We find that for PFP: DIP 1: 2 blends l(s)
<br>   is by a factor of similar to 4 smaller than in pure DIP films, while
<br>   l(s) of the PFP: DIP 2: 1 blends is not significantly reduced compared
<br>   with pure PFP. Yet, we observe an increase in l(s) with film thickness
<br>   for all of the samples, independent on the mixing ratio. In parallel
<br>   with the structural characterization we investigate the evolution of the
<br>   absorption spectra in the visible spectral range and its dependence on
<br>   l(s) in situ during film growth using differential reflectance
<br>   spectroscopy. We observe a surprisingly strong effect of changes in the
<br>   structural order on the shape of epsilon(2, xy)(E), evident by a
<br>   pronounced evolution of characteristic peaks in the thickness range from
<br>   1.6 nm to 9.6 nm. The combined results of the real-time experiments
<br>   allow to identify the thickness dependent crystal grain size as the
<br>   origin of the observed transient effects in the absorption spectra. (C)

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Chemically ordered alloys are useful in a variety of magnetic
<br>   nanotechnologies. They are most conveniently prepared at an industrial
<br>   scale using sputtering techniques. Here we describe a method for
<br>   preparing epitaxial thin films of B2-ordered FeRh by sputter deposition
<br>   onto single crystal MgO substrates. Deposition at a slow rate onto a
<br>   heated substrate allows time for the adatoms to both settle into a
<br>   lattice with a well-defined epitaxial relationship with the substrate
<br>   and also to find their proper places in the Fe and Rh sublattices of the
<br>   B2 structure. The structure is conveniently characterized with X-ray
<br>   reflectometry and diffraction and can be visualised directly using
<br>   transmission electron micrograph cross-sections. B2-ordered FeRh
<br>   exhibits an unusual metamagnetic phase transition: the ground state is
<br>   antiferromagnetic but the alloy transforms into a ferromagnet on heating
<br>   with a typical transition temperature of about 380 K. This is
<br>   accompanied by a 1% volume expansion of the unit cell: isotropic in
<br>   bulk, but laterally clamped in an epilayer. The presence of the
<br>   antiferromagnetic ground state and the associated first order phase
<br>   transition is very sensitive to the correct equiatomic stoichiometry and
<br>   proper B2 ordering, and so is a convenient means to demonstrate the
<br>   quality of the layers that can be deposited with this approach. We also
<br>   give some examples of the various techniques by which the change in
<br>   phase can be detected.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Using polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) we have investigated a
<br>   [YBa2Cu3O7(10 nm)/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (9 nm)] 10 (YBCO/LCMO) superlattice
<br>   grown by pulsed laser deposition on a La0.3Sr0.7Al0.65Ta0.35O3 (LSAT)
<br>   substrate. Due to the high structural quality of the superlattice and
<br>   the substrate, the specular reflectivity signal extends with a high
<br>   signal-to-background ratio beyond the fourth-order superlattice Bragg
<br>   peak. This allows us to obtain more detailed and reliable information
<br>   about the magnetic depth profile than in previous PNR studies on similar
<br>   superlattices that were partially impeded by problems related to the
<br>   low-temperature structural transitions of the SrTiO3 substrates. In
<br>   agreement with the previous reports, our PNR data reveal a strong
<br>   magnetic proximity effect showing that the depth profile of the magnetic
<br>   potential differs significantly from the one of the nuclear potential
<br>   that is given by the YBCO and LCMO layer thickness. We present fits of
<br>   the PNR data using different simple blocklike models for which either a
<br>   large ferromagnetic moment is induced on the YBCO side of the interfaces
<br>   or the ferromagnetic order is suppressed on the LCMO side. We show that
<br>   a good agreement with the PNR data and with the average magnetization as
<br>   obtained from dc magnetization data can only be obtained with the latter
<br>   model where a so-called depleted layer with a strongly suppressed
<br>   ferromagnetic moment develops on the LCMO side of the interfaces. We
<br>   also show that the PNR data are still compatible with the presence of a
<br>   small, ferromagnetic Cu moment of 0.25 mu(B) on the YBCO side that was
<br>   previously identified with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray
<br>   resonant magnetic reflectometry measurements on the same superlattice
<br>   [D. K. Satapathy et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 197201 (2012)]. We
<br>   discuss that the depleted layer thus should not be mistaken with a
<br>   ``dead'' layer that is entirely nonmagnetic but rather may contain a
<br>   canted antiferromagnetic or an oscillatory type of ordering of the Mn
<br>   moments that is not detected with the PNR technique. DOI:

<br>   The atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique offers controlled deposition

<br>   growth of LiNbO3. We here report on ALD deposition of LiNbO3 using

<br>   good control of cation stoichiometry and films with low impurity levels
<br>   of silicon. The deposited films are shown to be ferroelectric and their
<br>   crystalline orientations can be guided by the choice of substrate. The
<br>   films are polycrystalline on Si (100) as well as epitaxially oriented on
<br>   substrates of Al2O3 (012), Al2O3 (001), and LaAlO3 (012). The coercive
<br>   field of samples deposited on Si (100) was found to be similar to 220 kV
<br>   cm(-1), with a remanent polarization of similar to 0.4 mu C cm(-2).
<br>   Deposition of lithium containing materials is traditionally challenging
<br>   by ALD, and critical issues with such deposition are discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: Ni/NiO multilayers were grown by magnetron sputtering at room
<br>   temperature, with the aid of the natural oxidation procedure. That is,
<br>   at the end of the deposition of each single Ni layer, air is let to flow
<br>   into the vacuum chamber through a leak valve. Then, a very thin NiO
<br>   layer (similar to 1.2 nm) is formed. Simulated x-ray reflectivity
<br>   patterns reveal that layering is excellent for individual Ni-layer
<br>   thickness larger than 2.5 nm, which is attributed to the intercalation
<br>   of amorphous NiO between the polycrystalline Ni layers. The
<br>   magnetization of the films, measured at temperatures 5-300 K, has almost
<br>   bulk-like value, whereas the films exhibit a trend to perpendicular
<br>   magnetic anisotropy (PMA) with an unusual significant positive interface
<br>   anisotropy contribution, which presents a weak temperature dependence.
<br>   The power-law behavior of the multilayers indicates a non-negligible
<br>   contribution of higher order anisotropies in the uniaxial anisotropy.
<br>   Bloch-law fittings for the temperature dependence of the magnetization
<br>   in the spin-wave regime show that the magnetization in the multilayers
<br>   decreases faster as a function of temperature than the one of bulk Ni.
<br>   Finally, when the individual Ni-layer thickness decreases below 2 nm,
<br>   the multilayer stacking vanishes, resulting in a dramatic decrease of
<br>   the interface magnetic anisotropy and consequently in a decrease of the
<br>   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. (C) 2012 American Institute of

<br>   external magnetic field H applied in the plane of the sample with the
<br>   magnetization M confined in the plane for mu H-o = 6.0 T and partially
<br>   out of plane at 0.65 T. Nominal thicknesses of the Co and Pd layers were
<br>   2.5 and 21 angstrom, respectively. Because of these small values, the
<br>   actual layer chemical composition, thickness, and interface roughness
<br>   parameters were determined from the nuclear scattering length density
<br>   profile (rho(n)) and its derivative obtained from both x-ray
<br>   reflectivity and PNR, and uncertainties were determined using Monte
<br>   Carlo analysis. The PNR rho(n) showed that although D2 absorption
<br>   occurred throughout the samples, absorption in the multilayer stack was
<br>   modest (0.02 D per Pd atom) and thus did not expand. Direct magnetometry
<br>   showed that H-2 absorption decreased the total M at saturation and
<br>   increased the component of M in the plane of the sample when not at
<br>   saturation. The PNR magnetic scattering length density (rho(m)) revealed
<br>   that the Pd layers in the multilayer stack were magnetized and that
<br>   their magnetization was preferentially modified upon D-2 absorption. In
<br>   one sample, a modulation of M with twice the multilayer period was
<br>   observed at mu H-o = 0.65 T, which increased upon D-2 absorption. These
<br>   results indicate that H-2 or D-2 absorption decreases both the PMA and
<br>   total magnetization of the samples. The lack of measurable expansion
<br>   during absorption indicates that these changes are primarily governed by
<br>   modification of the electronic structure of the material.</td>

<br>   Pd-capped Mg/Ti multilayers with different periodicities.
<br>   Notwithstanding the large lattice mismatch between Mg and Ti, the
<br>   as-deposited metallic multilayers show good structural coherence. On
<br>   exposure to H-2 gas a two-step hydrogenation process occurs with the Ti
<br>   layers forming the hydride before Mg. From in situ measurements of the

<br>   large out-of-plane expansions of Mg and Ti layers on hydrogenation,
<br>   indicating strong plastic deformations in the films and a consequent
<br>   shortening of the coherence length. On unloading at room temperature in
<br>   air, hydrogen atoms remain trapped in the Ti layers due to kinetic
<br>   constraints. Such loading/unloading sequence can be explained in terms
<br>   of the different thermodynamic properties of hydrogen in Mg and Ti, as
<br>   shown by diffusion calculations on a model multilayered systems.
<br>   Absorption isotherms measured by hydrogenography can be interpreted as a

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The influence of titanium and vanadium on the hydrogen transport rate
<br>   through thin amorphous alumina films is addressed. Only small changes in
<br>   the transport rate are observed when the Al2O3 are covered with titanium
<br>   or vanadium. This is in stark contrast to results with a Pd overlayer,
<br>   which enhances the transport by an order of magnitude. Similarly, when
<br>   titanium is embedded into the alumina the transport rate is faster than
<br>   for the covered case but still slower than the undoped reference.
<br>   Embedding vanadium in the alumina does not yield an increase in uptake
<br>   rate compared to the vanadium covered oxide layers. These results add to
<br>   the understanding of the hydrogen uptake of oxidized metals, especially
<br>   the alanates, where the addition of titanium has been found to
<br>   significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen uptake. The current findings
<br>   eliminate two possible routes for the catalysis of alanates by Ti,
<br>   namely dissociation and effective diffusion short-cuts formed by Ti.
<br>   Finally, no photocatalytic enhancement was noticed on the titanium
<br>   covered samples. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: A direct method for the retrieval of electron density maps from surface
<br>   x-ray diffraction data is presented and its performance is evaluated.
<br>   The method, DCAF (difference map using the constraints of atomicity and
<br>   film shift), is based on the difference map iteration scheme and uses,
<br>   apart from the traditional constraints of atomicity, positivity and film
<br>   thickness, a novel constraint, which we have named the `film shift',
<br>   whereby the real space solution is shifted up by an out-of-plane unit
<br>   cell size of the underlying bulk substrate material if the topmost
<br>   region of the same thickness contains insignificant electron density.
<br>   This relaxes the film thickness constraint, which is necessarily loose
<br>   in order to accommodate structural uncertainties at the film-substrate
<br>   interface due to intermixing, roughness, and heteroepitaxial strain.
<br>   DCAF's performance was evaluated by retrieval of the electron density
<br>   distribution from a real data set, recorded from a five-monolayer film
<br>   of LaAlO3 on SrTiO3, which resulted in an electron density in good
<br>   agreement with the previously solved structure. Importantly, the
<br>   stability and reproducibility of the final solution compares favorably
<br>   with constraint combinations in which the film shift projection is
<br>   omitted, highlighting the power of this new method. In addition, an
<br>   example of a full structural solution for a three-monolayer-thick film
<br>   of La1-xSrxMnO3 on SrTiO3 is presented, where DCAF electron density
<br>   retrieval followed by model building and refinement was conducted.
<br>   It will be shown that DCAF can be successfully applied to thin films for
<br>   retrieving physically meaningful electron densities, and that it can
<br>   also serve as a starting point for subsequent structure refinement.</td>

	<td colspan="1"><b>Abstract</b>: The application of scattering methods in the study of biological and
<br>   biomedical problems is a field of research that is currently
<br>   experiencing fast growth. In particular, neutron reflectometry (NR) is a
<br>   technique that is becoming progressively more widespread, as indicated
<br>   by the current commissioning of several new reflectometers worldwide. NR
<br>   is valuable for the characterization of biomolecules at interfaces due
<br>   to its capability to provide quantitative structural and compositional
<br>   information on relevant molecular length scales. Recent years have seen
<br>   an increasing number of applications of NR to problems related to drug
<br>   and gene delivery. We start our review by summarizing the experimental
<br>   methodology of the technique with reference to the description of
<br>   biological liquid interfaces. Various methods for the interpretation of
<br>   data are then discussed, including a new approach based on the lattice
<br>   mean-field theory to help characterize stimulus-responsive surfaces
<br>   relevant to drug delivery function. Recent progress in the subject area
<br>   is reviewed in terms of NR studies relevant to the delivery of lipids
<br>   and DNA to surfaces. Lastly, we discuss two case studies to exemplify
<br>   practical features of NR that are exploited in combination with
<br>   complementary techniques. The first case concerns the interactions of
<br>   lipid-based cubic phase nanoparticles with model membranes (a drug
<br>   delivery application), and the second case concerns DNA compaction at
<br>   surfaces and in the bulk solution (a gene delivery application). (C)
