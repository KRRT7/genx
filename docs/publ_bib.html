	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) exhibits valuable characteristics concerning stability, green-processing, flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and ease of property modulation, qualifying it as one of the most promising p-type organic conductors for thermoelectric (TE) applications. While blending with inorganic counterparts is considered a good strategy to further improve polymeric TE properties, only a few attempts succeed so far due to inhomogeneous embedding and the non-ideal organic-inorganic contact. Here a new strategy to include nanoparticles (NPs) without any ligand termination inside PEDOT:PSS thin films is proposed. Spark discharge-generated tin oxide NPs (SnOx-NPs) are "gently" and homogenously deposited through low-energy diffusion mode. Strong interaction between naked SnOx-NPs and PSS chains occurs in the topmost layer, causing a structural reorganization towards an improved PEDOT chains crystalline packing at the bottom, providing a positive contribution to the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, dedoping and energy filtering effect introduced by the SnOx-NPs cause dramatic Seebeck coefficient enhancement. The optimized power factor of 116 mu Wm(-1) K-2 achieved is more than six times higher than the value found for the film without NPs. This easy and efficient strategy promises well for future mass production of flexible TE devices and the mechanism revealed may inspire future research on TEs and flexible electronics.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Removal of organic species from solid surfaces is a crucial process. The use of oppositely charged surfactants provides a potential method for enhanced removal. Neutron reflectometry has been used to investigate the complex behaviour of a pre-adsorbed and tenacious layer of the cationic surfactant didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) on a mica surface, during exposure to different organic species in solution. The anionic surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was shown to be able to remove the cationic layer, but only if anionic micelles were present in solution. To facilitate comparison with the behaviour of a non-ionic surfactant, the direct adsorption of pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E5) to mica was also studied; low surface coverage adsorption was seen at the critical micelle concentration and above. C12E5 was then found not to remove the cationic layer, but did include into the layer to some degree. The presence of cationic surfactant on the mica was however shown to significantly modify the adsorption behaviour of the non-ionic surfactant. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Hydrogen detection in a reliable, fast, and cost-effective manner is a prerequisite for the large-scale implementation of hydrogen in a green economy. Thin film Ta1-yPdy is presented as an effective optical sensing material with extremely wide sensing ranges covering at least 7 orders of magnitude in hydrogen pressure. Nanoconfinement of the Ta1-yPdy layer suppresses the first-order phase transitions present in bulk and ensures a sensing response free of any hysteresis. Unlike other sensing materials, Ta1-yPdy features the special property that the sensing range can be easily tuned by varying the Pd concentration without a reduction of the sensitivity of the sensing material. Combined with a suitable capping layer, sub-second response times can be achieved even at room temperature, faster than any other known thin-film hydrogen sensor.</td>

We synthetized different copolymers with a small hydrophobic PS block of constant length attached to polyelectrolyte PDMAEMA blocks of various lengths. We demonstrate that a Langmuir monolayer is formed with the hydrophobic collapsed PS block anchoring the hydrophilic polyelectrolyte at the interface. By combining macroscopic surface pressure measurements and specular neutron reflectivity, we studied the monolayers as a function of surface density sigma and pH of the subphase. At pH = 2, the PDMAEMA is fully charged and the system at high s behaves as a polyelectrolyte brush with chains protruding in water with a gaussian profile. At pH = 10 where the PDMAEMA is neutral, the system exhibits a phase transition between the pancake configuration to the brush configuration, with a threshold that depends on the PDMAEMA chain length, in agreement with theoretical predicted scaling laws.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The thermal stability of Cu/W nano-multilayers deposited on a Si substrate using ion beam deposition was analyzed in situ by GISAXS and transmission EDX-a combination of methods permitting the observation of diffusion processes within buried layers. Further supporting techniques such as XRR, TEM, WAXS, and AFM were employed to develop an extensive microstructural understanding of the multilayer before and during heating. It was found that the pronounced in-plane compressive residual stress and defect population induced by ion beam deposition result in low thermal stability driven by thermally activated self-interstitial and vacancy diffusion, ultimately leading to complete degradation of the layered structure at moderate temperatures. The formation of Cu protrusions was observed, and a model was formulated for stress-assisted Cu diffusion driven by Coble creep along W grain boundaries, along with the interaction with Si substrate, which showed excellent agreement with the observed experimental data. The model provided the explanation for the experimentally observed strong correlation between thin film deposition conditions, microstructural properties, and low thermal stability that can be applied to other multilayer systems.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) enhanced atomic layer etching (ALE) of thin (similar to 8nm) Ru films is demonstrated. Oxidation half-cycles of 2-5min VUV/O-2 co-exposure are used to oxidize near-surface Ru to RuO2 at 1Torr O-2 and 100-150 degrees C. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate that RuO2 formation saturates after similar to 5min of VUV/O-2 exposure at 100 and 150 degrees C. The depth of Ru oxidation is limited by the rate of oxidation and can be controlled with substrate temperature and exposure time. Etching half-cycles are performed by exposing the oxidized Ru film to HCOOH vapor at 0.50Torr for 30s isothermally, which results in the removal of the oxidized Ru layer. The amount of Ru removed per ALE cycle is determined by comparing ex situ x-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements of the film before and after etching. When using 2min VUV/O-2 co-exposure, approximately 0.8 and 0.9 angstrom of Ru is etched per cycle at 100 and 150 degrees C, respectively. XRR and atomic force microscopy measurements indicate that the as-deposited and sputtered Ru film surface becomes smoother as ALE is performed. The etch rate decreases with ALE cycles and corresponds to a slowing oxidation rate, which is likely associated with the decrease in surface roughness. Density functional theory is used to study the adsorption of oxidants in a model Ru system, and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations describe O diffusion into the Ru substrate by following an O "probe" atom as it moves between Ru(002) atomic planes with 0.50 monolayer (ML) O on the surface. NEB results reveal an approximate energetic barrier to diffusion, E-a, of 5.10eV for O to move through the second and third atomic Ru layers when O, which can form an RuOx species, is subsurface. This E-a is in excess of the energetic gain of 4.23eV in adsorbing an O atom to Ru(002) with 0.50ML O. The difference in E-a and the adsorption energy likely contributes to the self-limiting nature of the oxidation and explains the observation that VUV/O-2 co-exposure time must be increased to allow additional time for O diffusing into the subsurface as it overcomes the barrier to subsurface O diffusion. The self-limiting oxidation of Ru arising from VUV/O-2 at low temperatures, in turn, enables an ALE process for Ru.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Oxide spin detector materials are highly desired for emergent all-oxide spintronics. In this work, Permalloy/SrIrO3/Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)(0.7) Ti0.3O3 (Py/SIO/PMNPT) heterostructures were prepared by pulsed laser deposition of SIO thin films epitaxially on (001)-oriented single crystalline PMNPT substrates, followed by sputter deposition of Py films upon SIO through a shadow mask. The paramagnetic SIO layer, with a large spin-orbit coupling, serves as a detector to check the spin current pumped from the adjacent ferromagnetic Py layer through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). It is observed that the spin pumping amplitude can be reversibly tuned by about 50% through applying a 10kV/cm electric field on the piezoelectric PMNPT substrate. The ISHE voltage shows a butterfly hysteresis resembling the strain-field curve of PMNPT, indicating the relevance of strain coupling at the SIO/PMNPT interface. In situ x-ray diffraction reveals that both in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters of SIO vary with the field applied on PMNPT. These results highlight that SIO is a promising candidate material for spin detection, and the efficiency of spin to charge conversion in SIO can be tuned electrically in SIO/PMNPT heterostructures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Emergent behaviors occur when simple interactions between a system's constituent elements produce properties that the individual elements do not exhibit in isolation. This article reports tunable emergent behaviors observed in domain wall (DW) populations of arrays of interconnected magnetic ring-shaped nanowires under an applied rotating magnetic field. DWs interact stochastically at ring junctions to create mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These combine to give a dynamic, field-dependent equilibrium DW population that is a robust and emergent property of the array, despite highly varied local magnetic configurations. The magnetic ring arrays' properties (e.g., non-linear behavior, "fading memory" to changes in field, fabrication repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an interesting candidate system for realizing reservoir computing (RC), a form of neuromorphic computing, in hardware. By way of example, simulations of ring arrays performing RC approaches 100% success in classifying spoken digits for single speakers.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The nature of an interfacial structure buried within a device assembly is often critical to its function. For example, the dye/TiO2 interfacial structure that comprises the working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) governs its photovoltaic output. These structures have been determined outside of the DSC device, using ex situ characterization methods; yet, they really should be probed while held within a DSC since they are modulated by the device environment. Dye/TiO2 structures will be particularly influenced by a layer of electrolyte ions that lies above the dye self-assembly. We show that electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfacial structures can be resolved using in situ neutron reflectometry with contrast matching. We find that electrolyte constituents ingress into the self-assembled monolayer of dye molecules that anchor onto TiO2. Some dye/TiO2 anchoring configurations are modulated by the formation of electrolyte/dye intermolecular interactions. These electrolyte-influencing structural changes will affect dye-regeneration and electron-injection DSC operational processes. This underpins the importance of this in situ structural determination of electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfaces within representative DSC device environments.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetometry measurements of Fe/U and Ni/U bilayer systems reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the magnetic anisotropy for U thicknesses in the range of 0-8 nm with the Fe/U bilayers showing a more prominent effect as compared to Ni/U. The stronger response for Fe/U is ascribed to the stronger 3d-5f hybridization of Fe and U. This nonmonotonic behavior is thought to arise from quantum well states in the uranium overlayers. Estimating an oscillation period from the nonmonotonic data, and comparing it to Density Functional Theory calculations, we find that wave vector matches to the experimental data can be made to regions of high spectral density in (010) and (100) cuts of the electronic structure of a-U, consistent with the measured texture in the films. Unexpectedly, there are also indications of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a subset of Fe/U samples at relatively large U thickness.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This work is devoted to disclosing the effect of epitaxial strain on crystallographic, transport, and nonlinear optical properties of a bilayer structure consisting of one ferroelectric (FE) (BaTiO3 with a thickness of 4 nm) and one ferromagnetic (La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 with the thickness of 12 nm) layers. Both tensile (of about similar to 6% caused by the MgO substrate) and compressive (of about similar to 1% caused by the SrTiO3 substrate) strains reduce the bulk metal-to-insulator phase transition temperature of the La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 layer from 240 K towards 195 K and 160 K, respectively. The appearance of the effect of colossal electroresistance, linear and nonlinear current-voltage behaviours and contribution of FE polarization switching in the BaTiO3 layer to the conductivity are associated with the influence of epitaxial strain. The predominance of the compressive over the tensile strain leads to the hysteresis behaviour of electroresistance, maximum conductivity caused by the resonant-tunnelling mechanism, and strong nonlinear optical dependence on the applied electric field.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We show that a trilayer magnetic structure, consisting of a heavy metal (Platinum) as a buffer, an ultrathin ferromagnet (Cobalt) as a functional layer, and an antiferromagnetic insulator (Nickel oxide, NixOy) as a capping, is a host of intriguing physical phenomena desirable for spintronics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed changes in the ratio of NixOy phases with different stoichiometry. Due to strong spin-orbit coupling, the Pt layer induces perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Co, breaks its structural inversion symmetry, and causes an additive effect of Pt/Co and Co/NixOy interfaces to the effective interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-eff). Manipulation the magnetic anisotropy can be realized by the ferromagnetic layer thickness variation and modification of the Co/NixOy interface. The NixOy capping layer induces the exchange bias in Co, which effective field vertical bar Beb vertical bar can be controlled in the range from 0 to 24 mT. The magnitude and direction of B-eb does not affect D-eff. The increase of Ar pressure leads to structural transformation of the Co/NixOy interface and, consequently, to decrease of the surface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-s), the source of which is the NiO phase. We demonstrate that the studied Pt/Co/NixOy system has a number of functional properties useful for future logic and memory applications.</td>

Magnetic properties of the films were probed via superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. It was demonstrated that due to the hydrogen bonding between P4VP and PAA, the Fe3O4@PAA NPs segregate selectively inside P4VP domains, enhancing the microphase separation process. This in turn, together with employing carefully optimized dip-coating parameters, results in the formation of hybrid thin films with highly ordered nanostructures. The addition of Fe3O4@PAA nanoparticles does not change the average interdomain spacing in the film lateral nanostructure.

We find that the presence of the LSCO spacer and capping layers leads to ferromagnetism in ultra-thin LSMO layers with thicknesses of the order of 2 uc with the magnetic easy axis oriented in the film plane.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Titanium monoxide (TiO), an important member of the rock salt 3d transition-metal monoxides, has not been studied in the stoichiometric single-crystal form. It has been challenging to prepare stoichiometric TiO due to the highly reactive Ti2+. We adapt a closely lattice-matched MgO(001) substrate and report the successful growth of single-crystalline TiO(001) film using molecular beam epitaxy. This enables a first-time study of stoichiometric TiO thin films, showing that TiO is metal but in proximity to Mott insulating state. We observe a transition to the superconducting phase below 0.5 K close to that of Ti metal. Density functional theory (DFT) and a DFT-based tight-binding model demonstrate the extreme importance of direct Ti-Ti bonding in TiO, suggesting that similar superconductivity exists in TiO and Ti metal. Our work introduces the new concept that TiO behaves more similar to its metal counterpart, distinguishing it from other 3d transition-metal monoxides.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Nanoscale Ru/C multilayers are essential reflective optics in the hard x-ray region of 7-20 keV. To understand the layer growth behavior and develop ultrathin Ru/C multilayer mirrors with periods smaller than 3.0 nm, multilayers with different periods of 6.2-1.5 nm were fabricated and studied. It is found that the average interface width started to increase obviously when the period became smaller than 2.5 nm while the surface roughness of different multilayers remained almost the same. The intrinsic stress of the multilayer gradually decreased with decreasing period and reached a very low value of -82 MPa at d = 2.3 nm. High reflectance of 54% and 65% (at E = 8.04 keV) were demonstrated for the multilayers with periods of 2.5 nm and 3.0 nm, respectively, whereas that for 1.9 nm period was significantly lower. To further analyze the layer microstructure, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used. The polycrystallized structure of Ru remained similar for the multilayers with period less than 2.5 nm, while a non-continuous layer growth and severe intermixing between Ru and C were observed for the multilayer with period of 1.9 nm. The increased intermixing between Ru and C was found to be the main reason for the larger interface width and lower reflectance of the multilayers with period smaller than 2.5 nm. It also indicated that the layer thickness threshold for a Ru/C multilayer growing with good layer quality is 1.0-1.2 nm.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Ru/C multilayer mirrors with a period of 2.5 nm and 150 bilayers were studied under high-temperature annealing and long-term storage. A general increase in the reflectivity was observed after annealing at different temperatures from 300 to 700 degrees C, during which a maximum enhancement of around 14% was obtained at 600 degrees C. The highest reflectance measured at 8 keV reached 69% after 600 degrees C annealing. This was accompanied by a 6% expansion of the layer period, which could be mainly attributed to carbon layers. The surface roughness was not affected by the annealing, whereas the polycrystallization of Ru with crystallographic planes parallel to the layer interfaces was enhanced. Combining the transmission-electron microscopy measurements, it was found that the interdiffusion at the C-on-Ru interface was significantly suppressed. The decreased interdiffusion, enhanced optical contrast, and larger multilayer period were the main reasons for the increased reflectance. The 600 degrees C annealed Ru/C multilayer remained intact after 13 months of storage in air, which also demonstrated significant temporal stability.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Spin-pumping and spin-orbit torque efficiencies in ferromagnetic/heavy metal bilayers, which usually consist of the polycrystalline grains, are related to the spin current transmission from ferromagnets to heavy metals and vice versa, respectively. In this work, epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111) films were fabricated to investigate the spin-pumping efficiency and spin-orbit torque efficiency by ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall resistance measurement techniques, respectively. Ferromagnetic resonance results show that the incremental magnetic damping constants in epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111), compared with those of the epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/AlOx reference sample, depend on whether the external magnetic field is applied along the in-plane easy or hard axes of Fe0.79Si0.21. The Pt thickness-dependent anisotropic damping constant was ascribed to the anisotropic spin current absorption in epitaxial Pt(111) layer. When electric currents were applied along the easy and hard axes of Fe0.79Si0.21 in epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111) bilayers, a large difference between spin-orbit torques generated from Pt(111) was observed by a harmonic Hall resistance measurement method. Both of the results suggest that spin current transmission efficiency is related to the anisotropic spin Hall effect of epitaxial Pt(111) layer due to the different spin-orbit interaction energies along the different crystallographic directions of Pt.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Multilayer X-ray mirrors consist of a coating of a large number of alternate layers of high Z and low Z materials with a typical thickness of 10-100 angstrom, on a suitable substrate. Such coatings play an important role in enhancing the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors by allowing reflections at angles much larger than the critical angle of X-ray reflection for the given materials. Coating with an equal thickness of each bilayer (constant period multilayers) enhances the reflectivity at discrete energies, satisfying Bragg condition for the given thickness. However, by systematically varying the bilayer thickness in the multilayer stack (depth graded multilayers), it is possible to design X-ray mirrors having enhanced reflectivity over a broad energy range. One of the most important applications of such a depth graded multilayer mirror is to realize hard X-ray telescopes for astronomical purposes. Design of such multilayer X-ray mirrors and their characterization with X-ray reflectivity measurements require appropriate software tools that can compute X-ray reflectivity for the given set of parameters and geometry. We have initiated the development of hard X-ray optics for future Indian X-ray astronomical missions, and in this context, we have developed a program, DarpanX, to calculate X-ray reflectivity for single and multilayer mirrors. It can be used as a stand-alone tool for designing multilayer mirrors with required characteristics. But more importantly, it has been implemented as a local model for the popular X-ray spectral fitting program, XSPEC, and thus can be used for accurate fitting of the experimentally measured X-ray reflectivity data. DarpanX is implemented as a Python 3 module, and an API is provided to access the underlying algorithms. Here we present details of DarpanX implementation and its validation for different types of multilayer structures. We also demonstrate the model fitting capability of DarpanX for experimental X-ray reflectivity measurements of single and multilayer samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Noncovalent interactions at electrified interfaces are key to improving activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we showed that on RuO2(110) in alkaline solutions, OER activity is cation-dependent, being largest in 0.1 M KOH compared to LiOH and NaOH. Using crystal truncation rod analysis, -O is detected on the coordinatively unsaturated site at 1.5 V-RHE in 0.1 M KOH, suggesting that the rate-determining step is -O + OH- -> -OOH + e(-), which is different from that in acid involving the final deprotonation of -OOH. The ordering of interfacial water in base was found to decrease with increasing potential and independent of cations. Using surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, the density of isolated water molecules (zero H-bonds) was found to increase, and the density of icelike water molecules (four H-bonds) decreases from Li+ to K+ at OER potentials. The higher activity of more isolated interfacial OH - ions in the case of K+ and the lesser stabilization of -O intermediates by hydration water of K+ compared to Na+ and Li+ can result in higher OER activity for KOH. This work provides molecular details of the interface as a function of potential and electrolyte and enables the design of more active electrochemical interfaces.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Many polymorphic crystal structures of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) have been reported over the past few decades, but despite its manifold applicability, the structure of the frequently mentioned alpha polymorph remained unclear. The base-centered unit cell (space group C2/c) suggested in 1966 was ruled out in 2003 and was replaced by a primitive triclinic unit cell (space group P (1) over bar). This study proves unequivocally that both alpha structures coexist in vacuum-deposited CuPc thin films on native silicon oxide by reciprocal space mapping using synchrotron radiation in grazing incidence. The unit-cell parameters and the space group were determined by kinematic scattering theory and provide possible molecular arrangements within the unit cell of the C2Ic structure by excluded-volume considerations. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments and ex situ atomic force microscopy complement the experimental data further and provide insight into the formation of a smooth thin film by a temperature-driven downward diffusion of CuPc molecules during growth.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic molecules deposited on a metallic substrate constitute a method to engineer the spin properties of the molecule and has potential application in low-power information storage devices. Here, the authors investigate a superconductor/molecule/normal metal heterostructure and demonstrate spin-ordering and proximity induced superconducting properties at the metallo-molecular interface. Combining magnetic and superconducting functionalities enables lower energy spin transfer and magnetic switching in quantum computing and information storage, owing to the dissipationless nature of quasi-particle mediated supercurrents. Here, we put forward a system where emergent spin-ordering and diffusion of Cooper pairs are achieved at a non-intrinsically magnetic nor superconducting metallo-molecular interface. Electron transport, magnetometry and low-energy muon spin rotation are used to probe time-reversal symmetry breaking in these structures. By comparing the Meissner expulsion in a system including a Cu/C-60 spin-converter interface to one without, we observe a paramagnetic contribution that can be explained due to the conversion of spin-singlet Cooper pair states into odd-frequency triplet states. These results demonstrate the potential of metallo-molecular interfaces to achieve singlet to triplet Cooper pair conversion, a capability not present in either metal or molecule separately that could be used in the generation and controlled diffusion of spin polarised dissipationless currents.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Exotic material properties and topological nontrivial surface states have been theoretically predicted to emerge in [111]-oriented perovskite layers. The realization of such [111]-oriented perovskite superlattices has been found challenging, and even the growth of perovskite oxide films along this crystallographic direction has been proven as a formidable task, attributed to the highly polar character of the perovskite (111) surface. Successful epitaxial growth along this direction has so far been limited to thin film deposition techniques involving a relatively high kinetic energy, specifically pulsed laser deposition and sputtering. Here, we report on the self-regulated growth of [111]-oriented high-quality SrVO3 by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. The favorable growth kinetics available for the growth of perovskite oxides by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy on non-polar surfaces was also present for the growth of [111]-oriented films, resulting in high-quality SrVO3(111) thin films with residual resistivity ratios exceeding 20. The ability to grow high-quality perovskite oxides along energetically unfavorable crystallographic directions using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy opens up opportunities to study the transport properties of topological nontrivial and correlated electron systems.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In this study, we address the impact of Ti underlayer thickness (UL: 0-40 nm) on the structural, magnetic, and microscopic properties of TbFe thin films. The structural analysis confirmed the intermixing at interfaces of the Ti and TbFe layer with the increment of UL thicknesses. Out-of-plane (OOP) coercivity (H-c), and saturation field (H-s) gradually increased with an increase in UL thickness. For UL = 10 nm, the domain contrast and OOP stray field strength were enhanced, which may be due to the extent of d-d hybridization dominated over the influence of interfacial roughness. While for UL = 20, and 40 nm, the extent of interfacial roughness dominated the hybridization effects. In the case of UL: 20 nm, H-c increased by nearly 6 times more than the bare TbFe system. We observed a state with high OOP Hc combined with nearly zero OOP stray fields that are found to coexist in the sample. The magnetization reversal studies on a large area reveal domain nucleation followed by domain wall motion in all the films. The idea of tuning magnetic properties by varying thicknesses of Ti UL may be useful in spintronics applications.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The influence of a carbon barrier layer to improve the reflectivity of Cr/Ti multilayers, intended to be used in the water window wavelength regime, is investigated. Specular grazing-incidence X-ray reflectivity results of Cr/Ti multilayers with 10 bilayers show that interface widths are reduced to similar to 0.24 nm upon introduction of a similar to 0.3 nm C barrier layer at each Cr-on-Ti interface. As the number of bilayers increases to 75, a multilayer with C barrier layers maintains almost the same interface widths with no cumulative increase in interface imperfections. Using such interface-engineered Cr/C/Ti multilayers, a remarkably high soft X-ray reflectivity of similar to 31.6% is achieved at a wavelength of 2.77 nm and at a grazing angle of incidence of 16.2 degrees, which is the highest reflectivity reported so far in the literature in this wavelength regime. Further investigation of the multilayers by diffused grazing-incidence X-ray reflectivity and grazing-incidence extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements using synchrotron radiation suggests that the improvement in interface microstructure can be attributed to significant suppression of inter-diffusion at Cr/Ti interfaces by the introduction of C barrier layers and also due to the smoothing effect of the C layer promoting two-dimensional growth of the multilayer.</td>

A dilute 0.083 M instead of a 0.25 M solution together with an annealing step after every spin-coating cycle film gives rise to a significant improvement of ferroelectric properties. While a remanent polarization of 7 mu C/cm(2) was found for randomly oriented conventional films, the value of 15 mu C/cm(2) for the dilute solution is a result of a mixed 111 and 002 preferential orientation. A more than 50% improved breakdown voltage stems from a global density improvement from 8.0 to 8.4g/cm(3) as obtained from x-ray reflectivity (XRR). We also find superstructure peaks in XRR hinting on periodic alternations of the local density throughout the film thickness. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry confirm this periodicity. The sensitivity of XRR for this periodicity was leveraged to gain further insights in the origin of this superstructure with additional experiments. We conclude that both orientation and the superstructure are caused by a "layered structure" according to Schuler's microstructural zone model. However, our data also provide evidence for parallel chemical effects of cap formation in each stacked sub-layer. While this work shows a significant enhancement of ferroelectric properties, it also provides insights into further optimization potential of solution deposition of HfO2/ZrO2 thin films. Our XRR-based approach supplemented with suitable additional analysis can be of great value for the optimization of other solution-derived thin films beyond the material class studied here.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Combustion synthesis is a well-known method for synthesis of transparent metal oxide thin films at low temperature (<400 <degrees>C). However, their functional properties are often inferior due to high residual porosity originating from a release of large amounts of gaseous products during combustion reaction. In this paper, indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive oxide thin films are prepared through combustion synthesis at 350 degrees C and the porosity issue is explored via multilayer deposition. When the thickness of individual layers is downscaled from 12 to 3 nm, the density increases from 5.8 to 7.0 g cm(-3) and porosity decreases from 20 to 3%. This causes a strong boost of conductivity sigma (f) from 220 to 620 S cm(-1), the latter being one of the highest values ever reported for low-temperature processed ITO films. The effectiveness of this approach is attributed to a large specific surface area of thinner individual layers, which strongly enhances gas transport during the combustion process. We also show that improved crystallinity and a strong increase in tensile in-plane stress strongly contribute to the boost in conductivity.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a bottom-up surface functionalization to design hybrid molecular coatings that tether biomembranes using wet chemistry. First, a monolayer was formed by immersion in a NH2-Ar-SO3H solution, allowing aryldiazonium salt radicals to spontaneously bind to it via strong C bonding. After formation of the air-stable and dense molecular monolayer (-Ar-SO3H), a subsequent activation was used to form highly reactive -Ar-SO2Cl groups nearly perpendicular to the monolayer. These can bind commercial surfactants, PEGylated oligomers and other inexpensive molecules via their -OH, -COOH, or -NH2 chain end-moieties, to build hybrid coatings. Metal and oxidized chromium, semi-conductor n-doped silicon (111), are the substrates tested for this protocol and the aromatic organic monolayers formed at their surface are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS reveals unambiguously the presence of C-Cr and C-Si bonds, ensuring robustness of the coatings. Functional sulfur groups (-SO3H) cover up to 6.5 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of the silicon interface and 4.7 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of the oxidized chromium interface. These surface concentrations are comparable to the classic values obtained when the prefunctionalisation is driven by electrochemistry on conductors. Tethered lipid membranes formed on these coatings were analyzed by neutron reflectivity at the interface of functionalized n-doped silicon substrates after immersion in a solution of lipid vesicles and subsequent fusion. Results indicate a rather compact hybrid coating of Brij anchor-harpoon molecules that maintain a single lipid bilayer above the substrate, on top of a hydrated PEO cushion.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic Weyl semimetals are newly discovered quantum materials with the potential for use in spintronic applications. Of particular interest is the cubic Heusler compound Co2MnGa due to its inherent magnetic and topological properties. This work presents the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of magnetron co-sputtered Co2MnGa thin films, with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 80 nm. Polarized neutron reflectometry confirmed a uniform magnetization through the films. Hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a high degree of spin polarization and localized (itinerant) character of the Mn d (Co d) valence electrons and accompanying magnetic moments. Further, broadband and field orientation-dependent ferromagnetic resonance measurements indicated a relation between the thickness-dependent structural and magnetic properties. The increase of the tensile strain-induced tetragonal distortion in the thinner films was reflected in an increase of the cubic anisotropy term and a decrease of the perpendicular uniaxial term. The lattice distortion led to a reduction of the Gilbert damping parameter and the thickness-dependent film quality affected the inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. These experimental findings will enrich the understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetic Weyl semimetal thin films.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We studied the growth behavior, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of cobalt nitride (Co-N) thin films deposited using direct current (dc) and high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) processes. The N-2 partial gas flow (RN2) was varied in close intervals to achieve the optimum conditions for the growth of the tetra cobalt nitride (Co4N) phase. We found that Co-N films grown using the HiPIMS process adopt (111) orientation as compared to the growth taking place along the (100) direction in the dcMS process. It was observed that HiPIMS grown Co-N films were superior in terms of crystallite size and uniform surface morphology. The local structure of films was investigated using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. We found that the high energy of adatoms in the HiPIMS technique assisted in the more excellent stabilization of fcc-Co and the novel Co4N phase relative to the dcMS process. Magnetic properties of Co-N thin films were studied using magneto-optical Kerr effect, vibrating sample magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectivity. It was found that though the saturation magnetization remains almost similar in films grown by dcMS or HiPIMS processes, they differ in terms of their magnetic anisotropy. Such variation can be understood in terms of differences in the growth mechanisms in dcMS and HiPIMS processes affecting the resulting Co4N phase's local structure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Until recently, vapor-phase synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has relied on solid reactants which require relatively high temperatures and complex dosing schemes for sequential layer-by-layer processes. This work introduces a facile and high-performing layer-by-layer oxidative molecular layer deposition (oMLD) scheme using the volatile liquid oxidant antimony(V) chloride (SbCl5) to deposit PEDOT thin films. Effects of reactor parameters on PEDOT film characteristics are described, and the necessary foundation for future studies aiming to understand the nucleation and growth of layer-by-layer oMLD PEDOT is detailed.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Anion ordering is a promising route to engineer physical properties in functional heteroanionic materials. A central challenge in the study of anion-ordered compounds lies in developing robust synthetic strategies to control anion occupation and in understanding the resultant implications for electronic structure. Here, we show that epitaxial strain induces preferential occupation of F and O on the anion-sites in perovskite oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta F gamma films grown on different substrates. Under compressive strain, F tends to occupy the apical-like sites, which was revealed by F and O K-edge linearly polarized X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, resulting in an enhanced c-axis expansion. Under tensile strain, F tends to occupy the equatorial-like sites, enabling the longer Mn-F bonds to lie within the plane. The oxyfluoride films exhibit a significant orbital polarization of the 3d electrons, distinct F-site dependence to their valence band density of states, and an enhanced resistivity when F occupies the apical-like anion-site compared to the equatorial-like site. By demonstrating a general strategy for inducing preferential anion-site occupancy in oxyfluoride perovskites, this work lays the foundation for future materials design and synthesis efforts that leverage this greater degree of atomic control to realize new polar or quasi-two-dimensional materials.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the field of functional nanomaterials, core-satellite nanoclusters have recently elicited great interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, core-satellite synthetic routes to date are hampered by delicate and multistep reaction conditions and no practical method has been reported for the ordering of these structures onto a surface monolayer. Herein we show a reproducible and simplified thin film process to fabricate bimetallic raspberry nanoclusters using block copolymer (BCP) lithography. The fabricated inorganic raspberry nanoclusters consisted of a similar to 36 nm alumina core decorated with similar to 15 nm Au satellites after infusing multilayer BCP nanopatterns. A series of cylindrical BCPs with different molecular weights allowed us to dial in specific nanodot periodicities (from 30 to 80 nm). Highly ordered BCP nanopatterns were then selectively infiltrated with alumina and Au species to develop multi-level bimetallic raspberry features. Microscopy and X-ray reflectivity analysis were used at each fabrication step to gain further mechanistic insights and understand the infiltration process. Furthermore, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering studies of infiltrated films confirmed the excellent order and vertical orientation over wafer scale areas of Al2O3/Au raspberry nanoclusters. We believe our work demonstrates a robust strategy towards designing hybrid nanoclusters since BCP blocks can be infiltrated with various low cost salt-based precursors. The highly controlled nanocluster strategy disclosed here could have wide ranging uses, in particular for metasurface and optical based sensor applications.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The cellular membrane is central to the development of single-and multicellular life, as it separates the delicate cellular interior from the hostile environment. It exerts tight control over entry and exit of substances, is responsible for signaling with other cells in multicellular organisms and prevents pathogens from entering the cell. In the case of bacteria and viruses, the cellular membrane also hosts the proteins enabling invasion of the host organism. In a very real sense therefore, the cellular membrane is central to all life. The study of the cell membrane and membrane proteins in particular has therefore attracted significant attention. Due to the enormous variety of tasks performed by the membrane, it is a highly complex and challenging structure to study. Ideally, membrane components would be studied in isolation from this environment, but unlike water soluble proteins, the amphiphilic environment provided by the cellular membrane is key to the structure and function of the cell membrane. Therefore, model membranes have been developed to provide an environment in which a membrane protein can be studied. This review presents a set of tools that enable the comprehensive characterization of membrane proteins: electrochemical tools, surface plasmon resonance, neutron scattering, the surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy are discussed, with a particular focus on experimental technique and data evaluation.</td>

The Co-CoO multilayers were annealed up to 90min at 250 degrees C and they were found to be always in-plane magnetized. The value of Gilbert damping was evaluated. The multilayers after annealing or Ni addition show a small increase in coercivity without considerable changes in their anisotropy. The phenomenon of inverted hysteresis with negative remanence, with the field being applied perpendicular to the film plane, has been recorded. It was modeled with two coexisting magnetic moments with in-plane and perpendicular anisotropies, respectively.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The emergence of thin film CoFeB has driven research and industrial applications in the past decades, with the magnetic random access memory (MRAM) the most prominent example. Because of its beneficial properties, it fulfills multiple functionalities as information-storing, spin-filtering, and reference layer in magnetic tunnel junctions. In future, this versatility can be exploited beyond the traditional applications of spintronics by combining with advanced materials, such as oxide-based materials. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is their predominant growth-method, and thus the compatibility of CoFeB with this growth technique will be tested here. This encompasses a comprehensive investigation of the structural and magnetic propoperties. In particular, we find a substantial 'dead' magnetic layer and confirm that it is caused by oxidation employing the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) effect. The low damping encountered in vector network analyzer-based ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) renders them suitable for magnonics applications. These findings demonstrate that CoFeB thin films are compatible with emergent, PLD-grown materials, ensuring their relevance for future applications.</td>

By probing the ferromagnetic resonance modes with element-selective soft x-ray resonant reflectivity, we gain access to the magnetization dynamics as a function of depth. Most notably, using reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance, we find a phase lag between the coupled ferromagnetic layers in [CoFeB/MgO/Ta](4) multilayers that is invisible to other techniques. The use of reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance enables the time-resolved and depth-resolved probing of the complex magnetization dynamics of a wide range of functional magnetic heterostructures with absorption edges in the soft x-ray wavelength regime.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The transition-metal dichalcogenide HfS(2)is a promising alternative semiconductor with adequate band gap and high carrier mobility. However, a controllable growth of continuous HfS(2)films with selectivity for specific surfaces at a low temperature on a large scale has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, HfS(2)films are grown at 100 degrees C by atomic layer deposition (ALD) based on the precursors tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium and H2S. In situ vibrational spectroscopy allows for the definition of the temperature range over which (Me2N)(4)Hf chemisorbs as one monolayer. In that range, sequential exposures of the solid surface with (Me2N)(4)Hf and H2S result in self-limiting reactions that yield alternating surface termination with dimethylamide and thiol. Repeating the cycle grows smooth, continuous, stoichiometric films of thicknesses adjustable from angstroms to >100 nm, as demonstrated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, XRR, AFM, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and TEM. The well-defined surface chemistry enables one to deposit HfS(2)selectively using, for example, patterns generated in molecular self-assembled monolayers. This novel ALD reaction combines several attractive features necessary for integrating HfS(2)into devices.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Thin films of the correlated transition-metal oxide LaNiO3 undergo a

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin oxides are crucial for modern quantum electronic devices. However, the well -controlled growth of 2D oxide materials is highly challenging. In this work, ultrathin single-crystal SnO epitaxial films were achieved on r-sapphire by pulsed laser deposition. The quasi-2D SnO films have thicknesses ranging from 3.4 to 25.4 nm, allowing observation of quantum confinement effects in the optical bandgap. The critical thickness where the films relax in plane is around 19 nm. Below 19 nm, the films are strained compressively in plane and tensilely along the c-axis. Quantum confinement effects are observed by UV-IR spectroscopy for the optical transition at the direct bandgap. By fitting Brus equation, the reduced effective mass is deduced to be 0.137 +/- 0.016 me. The exciton radius and binding energy are 4.62 +/- 0.61 nm and 10.8 +/- 1.2 meV, respectively. These parameters are crucial for the design and application of SnO-based quantum devices.</td>

Despite its advantages, it has not been commercialized because of its metastability. GdFe12 is a material having ThMn12 structure. Therefore, it is expected to be difficult to stabilize GdFe12 in bulk form. In this study, GdFe12 was fabricated in the form of epitaxial thin films to stabilize the phase. The films were grown epitaxially from 500 degrees C to 200 degrees C. From the results of x-ray diffraction and x-ray absorption, it was confirmed that a (330) GdFe12 thin films were grown. The epitaxial GdFe12 thin film had a saturation magnetization (M-s) = 1130 emu/cm(3) and coercivity = 712 Oe at a deposition temperature of 400 degrees C.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Amorphous TbxCo100-x magnetic alloys exhibit a list of intriguing properties, such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high magneto-optical activity, and magnetization switching using ultrashort optical pulses. Varying the Tb:Co ratio in these alloys allows for tuning properties such as the saturation magnetic moment, coercive field, and the performance of light-induced magnetization switching. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic, optical, and magneto-optical properties of various TbxCo100-x thin-film alloy compositions. We report on the effect the choice of different seeding layers has on the structural and magnetic properties of TbxCo100-x layers. We also demonstrate that for a range of alloys, deposited on fused silica substrates, with Tb content of 24-30 at. %, helicity-dependent all-optical switching of magnetization can be achieved, albeit in a multishot framework. We explain this property to arise from the helicity-dependent laser-induced magnetization on the Co sublattice due to the inverse Faraday effect. Our paper provides an insight into material aspects for future potential hybrid magnetoplasmonic TbCo-based architectures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Density functional theory (DFT) is used to better understand the oxidation of Pd metal using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light co-exposed with O-2, which is known to produce O and O-3. The oxidation of Pd metal arising from O, O-2, and O-3 is assessed on bare Pd, Pd with a 0.25 monolayer of adsorbed atomic O, and Pd with increasing O incorporation into the substrate. DFT calculations are complemented experimentally by co-exposing 20 nm Pd films to 1 Torr of O-2 and VUV photons (6.5 < h nu < 11.3 eV) from a D-2 lamp at temperatures ranging from 50 to 200 degrees C and times from 30 s to 40 min. Oxidation of Pd is characterized using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Co-exposures at 50 degrees C and 1 Torr O-2 are performed with the Pd illuminated by the VUV light and shadowed from the VUV light in attempting to select for the oxidant that impinges on the Pd surface and causes oxidation. Results suggest that atomic O incident from the gas phase is responsible for oxidation of Pd, as no PdOx formation is observed for the same time period with the sample shadowed. Growth of PdOx via O diffusion is studied with the nudged elastic band method. Atomic O diffusion through Pd has an activation energy barrier of similar to 2.87 eV with respect to a surface O. This decreases to similar to 1.80 eV once the 0.25 monolayer of O occupies the surface. The extent of Pd oxidation is limited to the near-surface Pd region for all times and temperatures investigated. PdOx formation does not appear to exceed one to two atomic layers of Pd for conditions explored herein.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Separation of the anomalous Nernst and spin Seebeck voltages in bilayer

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: To optimize the catalytic functionality of cerium oxide it is important to understand the structural modifications associated with reduction and the role of the proximity of metals, which are often coupled with the oxide in the applications. For this purpose, the evolution of the short- and long-range structure of cerium oxide ultrathin epitaxial films and nanostructures supported on Pt(111) is investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ce L(3)edge and surface X-ray diffraction, during reduction by thermal treatments in vacuum. In epitaxial nanoislands reduction is associated with a contraction of the Ce-O distance and with the appearance of Ce-Pt bonds. The formation of a phase with a (2 x 2) periodicity after a thermal treatment at 1023 K is ascribed to the formation of a Pt5Ce alloy. Films of 3 nm thickness do not show, on average, significant structural modifications with the same thermal treatment, consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction involves only the topmost surface layers and it does not influence significantly the bulk structure of the material. This study demonstrates a strong interaction between cerium oxide and platinum, which has implications for the reactivity and stability of catalysts based on metals combined with reducible oxides.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Functional thin films are commonly integrated in electronic devices as part of a multi-layer architecture. Metal/oxide/metal structurese.g.in resistive switching memory and piezoelectric microelectrochemical devices are relevant applications. The films are mostly fabricated from the vapour phase or by solution deposition. Processing conditions with a limited thermal budget typically yield nanocrystalline or amorphous layers. For these aperiodic materials, the structure is described in terms of the local atomic order on the length scale of a few chemical bonds up to several nanometres. Previous structural studies of the short-range order in thin films have addressed the simple case of single coatings on amorphous substrates. By contrast, this work demonstrates how to probe the local structure of two stacked functional layers by means of grazing incidence total X-ray scattering and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The key to separating the contributions of the individual thin films is the variation of the incidence angle below the critical angle of total external reflection, In this way, structural information was obtained for functional oxides on textured electrodes,i.e.PbZr(0.53)O(0.47)O(3)on Pt[111] and HfO(2)on TiN, as well as HfO2-TiO(x)bilayers. For these systems, the transformations from disordered phases into periodic structuresviathermal teatment are described. These examples highlight the opportunity to develop a detailed understanding of structural evolution during the fabrication of real thin film devices using the PDF technique.</td>

<br>   the vapour phase or by solution deposition. Processing conditions with a
<br>   limited thermal budget typically yield nanocrystalline or amorphous
<br>   layers. For these aperiodic materials, the structure is described in
<br>   terms of the local atomic order on the length scale of a few chemical
<br>   bonds up to several nanometres. Previous structural studies of the
<br>   short-range order in thin films have addressed the simple case of single
<br>   coatings on amorphous substrates. By contrast, this work demonstrates
<br>   how to probe the local structure of two stacked functional layers by
<br>   means of grazing incidence total X-ray scattering and pair distribution
<br>   function (PDF) analysis. The key to separating the contributions of the
<br>   individual thin films is the variation of the incidence angle below the
<br>   critical angle of total external reflection, In this way, structural
<br>   information was obtained for functional oxides on textured
<br>   electrodes,i.e.PbZr(0.53)O(0.47)O(3)on Pt[111] and HfO(2)on TiN, as
<br>   well as HfO2-TiO(x)bilayers. For these systems, the transformations from
<br>   disordered phases into periodic structuresviathermal teatment are
<br>   described. These examples highlight the opportunity to develop a
<br>   detailed understanding of structural evolution during the fabrication of
<br>   real thin film devices using the PDF technique.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In crystalline materials, the presence of surfaces or interfaces gives rise to crystal truncation rods (CTRs) in their X-ray diffraction patterns. While structural properties related to the bulk of a crystal are contained in the intensity and position of Bragg peaks in X-ray diffraction, CTRs carry detailed information about the atomic structure at the interface. Developments in synchrotron X-ray sources, instrumentation, and analysis procedures have made CTR measurements into extremely powerful tools to study atomic reconstructions and relaxations occurring in a wide variety of interfacial systems, with relevance to chemical and electronic functionalities. In this review, an overview of the use of CTRs in the study of atomic structure at interfaces is provided. The basic theory, measurement, and analysis of CTRs are covered and applications from the literature are highlighted. Illustrative examples include studies of complex oxide thin films and multilayers.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Artificial ferromagnetic (FM)/nonmagnetic multilayers, with large enough FM thickness to prevent the dominance of interface anisotropies, offer a straightforward insight into the understanding and control of perpendicular standing spin wave (PSSW) modes. Here we present a study of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of [Co(3.0 nm)/Au(0.6nm)](1 <= N <= 30) multilayers. Magnetometry reveals that the samples exhibit magnetization reversal properties typical of an effective single layer with weak perpendicular anisotropy, with the distinctive thickness-dependent magnetization reorientation transition from uniform in-plane to out-of-plane stripe domains at remanence. However, when such multilayer systems are out-of-plane saturated, the dynamic response reveals the existence of several different ferromagnetic resonances in the form of PSSW modes that strongly depend on the material modulation characteristics along the total thickness. These modes are induced by the layer stacking itself as the effective single layer model fails to describe the observed complex dynamics. In contrast to most systems considered in the past, described by a dynamic model of a single effectively homogeneous thick layer, the specific structures investigated here provide a unique platform for a large degree of tunability of the mode frequencies and amplitude profiles. We argue that the combination of periodic magnetic properties with vertical deformation gradients, arising from heteroepitaxial strain relaxation, converts the Au interlayer regions into a vertical regular array of magnetic pinning planes for the PSSW modes, which promotes the complex dynamics observed in this system.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We demonstrate the manipulation of magnetic phases in FeRh thin films through atomic displacements and the distribution of structural defects. Atomic scale disorder can be controlled via irradiation with light noble gas ions, producing depth-varying nanoscale phase configurations of distinct antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic regions. Here, we perform a spatial characterization of the magnetic phases and the local magnetic environment around the Fe atoms, as well as the variation of the open-volumes around atomic sites. Thus, a direct correspondence between the existence of the three magnetic phases and lattice defects is revealed. By careful selection of the irradiating fluence, we show that it is possible to produce simple and thermally stable magnetic configurations, such as uniform magnetization or a bilayer phase structure. Furthermore, the thin film surface and interfaces are observed as the nucleation sites for the transitions between the phases. These results demonstrate a sensitive nanoscale manipulation of magnetic properties, shedding light on magnetic ordering in alloy lattices and broadening the scope for applications.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Synthesis of crystallographically well-defined thin films of topological materials is important for unraveling their mesoscale quantum properties and for device applications. Mn3Ge, an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal with a chiral magnetic structure on a kagome lattice, is expected to have enhanced Berry curvature around Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy, leading to large anomalous Hall/Nernst effects and a large spin-Hall effect. Using magnetron sputtering, we have grown epitaxial thin films of hexagonal D0(19) Mn3Ge that are flat and continuous. Large anomalous Nernst and inverse spin-Hall effects are observed in thermoelectric and spin-pumping devices. The anomalous Nernst signal in our Mn3Ge films is estimated to be 0.1 mu,V/K and is comparable to that in ferromagnetic Fe, despite Mn3Ge having a weak magnetization of similar to 3.5 m mu(B)/Mn at room temperature. The spin-mixing conductance is 90.5 nm(-2) at the Py/Mn3Ge interface, and the spin-Hall angle in Mn3Ge is estimated to be about eight times of that in Pt.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-d/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta (LSCO/LSMO) bilayer system is an ideal perovskite oxide platform for investigating interface reconstruction and its effect on their magnetic properties. Previous studies have shown that LSCO can separate into magnetic sublayers, which possess distinct trends as the total LSCO thickness increases. In this study, we used polarized neutron reflectometry to quantify changes in the magnetic and chemical depth profiles, and it confirms the formation of similar to 12 angstrom-thick interfacial LSCO and LSMO layers, characterized by a decreased nuclear scattering length density compared to the bulk of the layers. This decrease is attributed to the combined effects of oxygen vacancy formation and interfacial charge transfer, which lead to magnetically active Co2+ ions with ionic radii larger than the Co3+/Co4+ ions typically found in bulk LSCO or single-layer films. The interfacial magnetization values, as well as Co2+ ion and oxygen vacancy concentrations, depend strongly on the LSCO layer thickness. These results highlight the sensitive interplay of the cation valence states, oxygen vacancy concentration, and magnetization at interfaces in perovskite oxide multilayers, demonstrating the potential to tune their functional properties via careful design of their structure.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Thin film fabrication of 2D layered organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-OIHPs) for spintronic applications has been attempted using solution-based process like Langmuir-Blodgett technique. However, monolayer or few-layered 2D magnets are not yet realized, even though a wide spectrum of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) OIHPs are known as quasi-2D Heisenberg magnets in bulk compounds. Here, chemical exfoliation by solvent engineering is applied to successfully synthesize large-sized, few unit-cell-thick 2D RP-OIHPs. Comprehensive structural characterization reveals that binary co-solvents with high relative polarity in spin coating technique are the most effective among nine kinds of solvents. Above all, this enables few-layered 2D RP-OIHP ultrathin films sustaining their intrinsic magnetic order. It is found that XY-like magnetic anisotropy driven by Jahn-Teller effect responsible for ferromagnetism in seven-layered (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)CuCl4 ultrathin films remains very robust, whereas Ising-like dipolar anisotropy responsible for canted antiferromagnetism in ten-layered (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)MnCl4 ultrathin films is greatly reduced. It is expected that ferromagnetism even at monolayer limit should be possible by means of further sophisticated solvent engineering as long as Jahn-Teller effect is active. The chemical exfoliation using solvent engineering unambiguously can bring about a new breakthrough in the development of 2D RP-OIHP van der Waals magnets for ultrahigh energy-efficient spintronic, opto-spintronic devices.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The ability to tune the competition between the in-plane and out-of-plane orientation of magnetization provides a means to construct thermal sensors with a sharp spin reorientation transition at specific temperatures. We have observed such a tuneable, temperature-driven spin reorientation in structurally amorphous, ferrimagnetic rare-earth transition-metal alloy thin films using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and magnetic measurements. The nature of the spin reorientation transition in FeGd can be fully explained by a nonequilibrium, nanoscale modulation of the chemical composition of the films. This modulation leads to a magnetic domain pattern of nanoscale speckles superimposed on a background of in-plane domains that form Landau configurations in mu m-scale patterned elements. It is this speckle magnetic structure that gives rise to a sharp two-step reversal mechanism that is temperature dependent. The possibility to balance competing anisotropies through the temperature opens opportunities to create and manipulate topological spin textures.</td>

A larger net Co valence in films grown at substrate temperatures below 350 degrees C results in a smaller lattice parameter, a smaller optical band gap, and stronger magnetic exchange bias. Observation of this phenomena suggests a complex interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics during ESO synthesis; specifically thermal history, oxygen chemical potential, and entropy. In addition to the compositional degrees of freedom available to ESO systems, subtle nuances in atomic structure at constant metallic element proportions can strongly influence properties, simultaneously complicating physical characterization and providing opportunities for property tuning and development.</td>

An about 30 nm thin PPy film was deposited on a silicon single crystal by fast potential cycling, providing a dense film of an extraordinary small surface roughness. XRR was recorded from the PPy film in an aqueous 0.1 M perchloric acid at electric potentials between -0.2 V and +0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The PPy film shows typical reversible and linear changes in film thickness and electron density arising from the potential-dependent electrolyte incorporation. By introducing EC-XRR, a comprehensive analysis combining in situ XRR and EC, the net number of electrons passing through the PPy-electrolyte interface was deduced along with the potential-induced thickness variations, indicating a complex exchange mechanism. Evidently, along with the anion transfer, parallel charge compensation by protons and a volume and electron compensating counterflow of solvent molecules take place. Complementary time-dependent EC-XRR scans indicate that these exchange mechanisms are individual in two potential ranges. The low actuation along with a high pseudocapacitance suggest the fast potentiodynamically deposited PPy film as a promising supercapacitor material.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is
<br>   one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults
<br>   worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a
<br>   mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional
<br>   deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled
<br>   electrophysiological-mechanical model with several free parameters that
<br>   are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The
<br>   calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm
<br>   (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration
<br>   of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several
<br>   minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter
<br>   tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a
<br>   simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The
<br>   model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more
<br>   realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to
<br>   run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a
<br>   parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor
<br>   taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel
<br>   DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort
<br>   achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time.
<br>   While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the
<br>   resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve
<br>   damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Nitrogen ion implantation is a useful technique to put nitrogen ions into lattices. In this work, nitrogen ion implantation into epitaxial Mo films is performed to create a buried superconducting gamma-Mo2N. Atomically flat epitaxial (110) Mo films are grown on (0001) Al2O3. By impinging nitrogen ions, where the beam energy is fixed to 20 keV, we observe (111) gamma-Mo2N diffraction and the formation of a gamma-Mo2N layer from X-ray reflectivity. Magnetization and transport measurements clearly support a superconducting layer in the implanted film. Our strategy shows that formation of a buried superconducting layer can be achieved through ion implantation and self-annealing.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Manipulating topotactic phase transformations via orderly ion transfer in complex oxides ABO(x) is ubiquitous in advanced applications such as ionotronics, ion-batteries and catalysts. Most of such ion-mediated transformations are accomplished by the transfer of oxygen or A-site ions. However, implementing the transformation via the transfer of B-site ions, despite the great challenge to overcome a large cohesive energy, has unique advantage since they host most functional properties of materials. Here, we present a tri-state phase transformation from perovskite (P) to brownmillerite (BM) and to single-layered perovskite (SL) structure via the concerted migration of oxygen and B-site Co-ions in La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 thin films. Ac-STEM, XPS, XAS, PNR, magnetic and electric measurements demonstrated that presented B-site Co-cation transfer is along the CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer of the BM film, which leads to the reconfiguration of 3d-electrons and spin state in remanent Co ions and causes tremendous changes in magnetic and electric properties: from canted-antiferromagnetic insulator in BM phase to ferromagnetic insulator in SL phase. First-principles calculations revealed that the La3+-doping at A-site largely reduces the cohesive energy of Co-ions in CoO4 and destabilize the CoO4 tetrahedron of BM phase, which explains the formation of Co-ions transfer channel in the CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer. The present study highlights the effectiveness of regulating topotactic transformation via B-site ions transfer and provides a new pathway for manipulating the topotactic transformation with diverse functionalities.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Control of BO(6)octahedral rotations at the heterointerfaces of dissimilar ABO(3)perovskites has emerged as a powerful route for engineering novel physical properties. However, its impact length scale is constrained at 2-6 unit cells close to the interface and the octahedral rotations relax quickly into bulk tilt angles away from interface. Here, a long-range (up to 12 unit cells) suppression of MnO(6)octahedral rotations in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)through the formation of superlattices with SrTiO(3)can be achieved. The suppressed MnO(6)octahedral rotations strongly modify the magnetic and electronic properties of La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)and hence create a new ferromagnetic insulating state with enhanced Curie temperature of 235 K. The emergent properties in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)arise from a preferential occupation of the out-of-plane Mnd(3)(z)(-)(r)(2)(2)orbital and a reduced Mn e(g)bandwidth, induced by the suppressed octahedral rotations. The realization of long-range tuning of BO(6)octahedra via superlattices can be applicable to other strongly correlated perovskites for exploring new emergent quantum phenomena.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is suppressed by a large number of defects in the interface of heterostructure due to lattice mismatch. In this paper, the (001) oriented rutile MnO2 thin films with different thicknesses were grown on rutile TiO2 substrates. The lattice mismatch between film and substrate was minimized through a Ti diffusion self-adapting layer. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy mappings were used to measure the diffusion range of Ti. The results of high-resolution X-ray diffraction confirmed that the dependence of the out-of-plane lattice parameter on the thickness was consistent with the self-adapting interface model, indicating that Ti diffusion can indeed alleviate the lattice mismatch. In addition, the results of the synchrotron soft X-ray absorption spectrum indicated that the capacitance of the thin films with a large proportion of Ti diffusion increased with electrons involved in the reaction. Although the decrease of carrier density and conductivity of the thinner films depressed the electrochemical activity, it is worth mentioning that the film we designed still has considerable specific capacitance even when it is very thin, which can provide a new idea for the development of thinner and larger capacity potential micro-supercapacitors.</td>

To further improve the layer structure, Pd/B4C multilayers with a d-spacing of 2.5 nm were fabricated by magnetron sputtering using the heavy noble gas Kr and compared with the conventional ones fabricated by Ar. Although the Kr-sputtering process can work at a lower pressure, the interface width-especially the interface roughness-is a little larger than that made by Ar. A stronger polycrystallization and a lower content of sputter gas atoms were found in the Kr-made sample, which can be explained by the joint effect from less recoiled particles and lower sputtering pressure. A good reflectance of 68% of the Kr made multilayer was measured at 10 keV, which is only slightly lower than that of the Ar made sample (71%).</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The effect of water on the electroactive structuring of a tribologically relevant ionic liquid (IL) when dispersed in a polar solvent has been investigated at a gold electrode interface using neutron reflectivity (NR). For all solutions studied, the addition of small amounts of water led to clear changes in electroactive structuring of the IL at the electrode interface, which was largely determined by the bulk IL concentration. At a dilute IL concentration, the presence of water gave rise to a swollen interfacial structuring, which exhibited a greater degree of electroresponsivity with applied potential compared to an equivalent dry solution. Conversely, for a concentrated IL solution, the presence of water led to an overall thinning of the interfacial region and a crowding-like structuring, within which the composition of the inner layer IL layers varied systematically with applied potential. Complementary nanotribotronic atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements performed for the same IL concentration, in dry and ambient conditions, show that the presence of water reduces the lubricity of the IL boundary layers. However, consistent with the observed changes in the IL layers observed by NR, reversible and systematic control of the friction coefficient with applied potential was still achievable. Combined, these measurements provide valuable insight into the implications of water on the interfacial properties of ILs at electrified interfaces, which inevitably will determine their applicability in tribotronic and electrochemical contexts.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: One of the challenges of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is the synthesis of oxides containing metals with high electronegativity (metals that are hard to oxidize). The use of reactive organometallic precursors can potentially address this issue. To investigate the formation of radicals in MBE, we explored three carefully chosen metal-organic precursors of tin for SnO2 and BaSnO3 growth: tetramethyltin (TMT), tetraethyltin (TET), and hexamethylditin (HMDT). All three precursors produced single-crystalline, atomically smooth, and epitaxial SnO2 (101) films on r-Al2O3 ( 10 1 <overbar></mml:mover> 2 <mml:mo stretchy="false">) in the presence of oxygen plasma. The study of growth kinetics revealed reaction-limited and flux-limited regimes except for TET, which also exhibited a decrease in the deposition rate with increasing temperature above similar to 800 degrees C. Contrary to these similarities, the performance of these precursors was dramatically different for BaSnO3 growth. TMT and TET were ineffective in supplying adequate tin, whereas HMDT yielded phase-pure, stoichiometric BaSnO3 films. Significantly, HMDT resulted in phase-pure and stoichiometric BaSnO3 films even without the use of an oxygen plasma (i.e., with molecular oxygen alone). These results are discussed using the ability of HMDT to form tin radicals and therefore assisting with Sn -> Sn4+ oxidation reaction. Structural and electronic transport properties of films grown using HMDT with and without oxygen plasma are compared. This study provides guideline for the choice of precursors that will enable the synthesis of metal oxides containing hard-to-oxidize metals using reactive radicals in MBE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Water-gated organic field-effect transistors (WGOFETs) are relevant devices for use in the fields of biosensors and biosystems. However, real applications require very stringent performance in terms of electrochemical stability and charge mobility to the organic semiconductor in contact with an aqueous environment. Here, a comparative study of two small-molecule electron-transporting perylenediimide semiconductors, which differ only in the N-substituents named PDIF-CN2 and PDI8-CN2 is reported. The two materials present similar solid-state arrangements but, while the PDI8-CN2 shows a more 3D growth modality and electron mobility independent of the semiconductor layer thickness (approximate to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), the PDIF-CN2 has an almost-2D growth modality and the mobility increases with the semiconductor film thickness, reaching a maximum value of approximate to 5 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 30 nm. Above this thickness, the PDIF-CN2 switches to a more 3D growth modality, and the mobility drops by one order of magnitude. XRR analysis indicates that a PDIF-CN2 film can be modeled as a dense layered structure in which each layer is decoupled from the others due to the presence of fluorocarbon-chains. The availability of additional pathways for charge transport from buried layers and the 2D versus 3D growth can explain the mobility dependence on the film thickness.</td>

The exchange-spring magnet is a trilayer consisting of two ferromagnetic layers with high T-c separated by a ferromagnetic layer, which is engineered to have a significantly lower T-c than the embedding layers. This enables us to measure magnetization depth profiles at which the low-T-c material is in a ferromagnetic or paramagnetic state, while the embedding layers are ferromagnetic. A clear proximity effect is observed 7 K above the intrinsic T-c of the embedded layer, with a range extending 50 angstrom.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Electrification of vehicles and renewable energy is increasing the demand for permanent magnets, but the cost and scarcity of rare-earth metals is an obstacle. Creating nanocomposites of rigidly exchange-coupled hard and soft magnets, for which the magnetization reversal occurs as in a single magnetic-phase material, is a promising route toward rare-earth-lean permanent magnets with high energy products. The hard/soft exchange coupling is, however, often reduced due to rough interfaces and structural defects, resulting in exchange-spring behavior rather than rigid exchange coupling. Here, it is shown that artificially sandwiched hard and soft amorphous magnets produced by magnetron sputtering exhibit smooth interfaces, and the first order reversal curve (FORC) technique is used to show that the hard and the soft phases are rigidly exchange coupled. Micromagnetic simulations, using a random-anisotropy model, are used to predict the thickness limit of the rigid exchange coupling. A great advantage of amorphous hard/soft composites is the possibility to obtain a wide range of magnetic properties by finely tuning the composition of the individual phases.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling the activity of a given catalyst. This work combines operando characterization and computational techniques to examine the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on RuO2 surfaces. Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling (electro)catalytic activity. Here we employed surface X-ray scattering coupled with density functional theory and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to examine the oxygen evolution reaction on RuO2 surfaces as a function of voltage. At 1.5 V-RHE, our results suggest that there is an -OO group on the coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium (Ru-CUS) site of the (100) surface (and similarly for (110)), but adsorbed oxygen on the Ru-CUS site of (101). Density functional theory results indicate that the removal of -OO from the Ru-CUS site, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a neighbouring -OH (-OO-H), could be the rate-determining step for (100) (similarly for (110)), where its reduced binding on (100) increased activity. A further reduction in binding energy on the Ru-CUS site of (101) resulted in a different rate-determining step (-O + H2O - (H+ + e(-)) -> -OO-H) and decreased activity. Our study provides molecular details on the active sites, and the influence of their local coordination environment on activity.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Expanding the application space of transparent electrodes toward the ultraviolet range has been found challenging when utilizing the conventional approach to degenerately dope semiconductors with band gaps larger than ZnO or In2O3. Here, it is shown that the correlated metal SrxNbO3 with x < 1 is ideally suited as a UV-transparent electrode material, enabling UV light-emitting diodes for a wide range of applications from water disinfection to polymer curing. It is demonstrated that SrxNbO3 thin films can be grown by radio frequency (RF) sputtering and that they remain in the perovskite phase despite a sizeable Sr deficiency. The electrical and optical properties are characterized and compared to those of commonly used indium tin oxide (ITO) and Sn-doped Ga2O3 transparent conductor standards. SrxNbO3 films were found to have sheet resistances as low as 30 Omega sq(-1) with optical transmission at a wavelength of 280 nm up to 86%, marking a two-order-of-magnitude increase over the performance of traditional UV-transparent conductors. The compatibility of SrxNbO3 with a physical vapor deposition technique that is widely employed in the transparent conductor coating industry along with the robustness of the highly electrically conducting and optically transparent perovskite phase makes it an ideal transparent electrode for applications in the UV spectrum.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We present a detailed analysis of the in-plane magnetic vector

<br>   bombardment induced magnetic patterning of a CoFe/IrMn3 exchange bias
<br>   thin-film system. Quantitative information about the chemical and

<br>   reveals a domain width imbalance of 5.3 to 3.7 mu m of virgin and

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Behaviour of interface properties and propagation of interfacial atomic

<br>   of layers are added in the multilayer stack. As a result of Co diffusion
<br>   into Ti the physical density of Ti layer increases and also effective
<br>   thickness of Co layer decreases. Since the thickness of the Ti layers
<br>   are in sub-nm range, it is found that this diffusion is not limited only

<br>   bulk of Ti layer. Finally, soft X-ray reflectivity measurement on the

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cr/Ti multilayers with moderate to low bi-layer thickness have been deposited by Ion beam sputtering system and have been investigated thoroughly by specular grazing incidence X-ray reflectivity (GIXR) and diffused X-ray scattering (both in coplanar and non-coplanar configurations) measurements. The investigation is important for development of Cr/Ti soft X-ray multilayer mirrors for "water window" applications in the wavelength regime of 2.2-4.4 nm. Initially few multilayers have been deposited and the highest reflectivity at first Bragg peak positions of the GIXR plots have been obtained for the Cr layer to bi-layer thickness ratio of 0.4. Subsequently, keeping the ratio fixed a set of five samples with bi-layer thickness varying from 3.8 nm to 2.1 nm have been prepared. For the all five ML samples reported in this communication, Ti layer thickness is greater than 1.3 nm, however, the Cr layer thickness varies from 1.5 to 0.8 nm in the above range of bi-layer thickness and it undergoes continuous-to discontinuous transition. Cr films undergo significant change in morphology as the thickness changes and thus the interfaces are also evolved differently. Analysis of the diffused X-ray scattering data shows that interface imperfection of Ti-on-Cr interfaces is dominated by interface diffusion at low Cr thickness (discontinuous) regime and by interface roughness at high Cr thickness (continuous) regime, while in case of Cr-on-Ti interfaces, interface roughness dominates throughout the whole thickness regime. For the sample with highest bi-layer thickness of 3.8 nm high Bragg peak reflectivity value close to the ideal case is obtained manifesting high thickness uniformity, very low interface imperfection and high vertical correlation length across the interfaces for this sample which is also confirmed by cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy. A 50 bi-layer sample prepared with the above bi-layer thickness shows high reflectivity of 5.6% at 2.84 nm water window soft X-ray wavelength.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We studied the magnetization (M-s) of 60 nm thick polycrystalline Fe4N
<br>   thin films deposited using reactive dc magnetron sputtering. The optimum
<br>   substrate temperature (T-s) to grow an stoichiometric Fe4N phase is
<br>   about 673 K, in agreement with earlier works. However, at this T-s, we
<br>   found that significant intermixing is taking place at the substrate-film
<br>   interface, affecting the M-s of Fe4N film, adversely. We performed
<br>   secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements to extract the
<br>   extent of such intermixing. It was found that Si from the SiO2 substrate
<br>   get interdiffused into Fe4N film forming an undesired interface
<br>   extending up to almost half of the film. As a result, the average M-s of
<br>   Fe4N film get reduced by about 25% as compared to its theoretical
<br>   value. To prohibit such intermixing, we placed thin layers of Ag, Cu, or
<br>   CrN as a buffer layer between the substrate and Fe4N film. Such buffer
<br>   layer suppress the extent of interdiffusion remarkably. From SIMS
<br>   measurements, we found that among all buffer layers, CrN is most
<br>   suitable as it reduces the extent of intermixing to a minimum level.
<br>   Magnetization measurements performed using bulk magnetization and
<br>   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) methods also clearly revealed that
<br>   the M-s was the highest when CrN buffer layer was used. From these
<br>   results, it becomes apparent that the intermixing taking place at the
<br>   substrate-film interface plays a vital role in affecting the M-s of Fe4N
<br>   thin films. To further suppress such intermixing an attempt was also
<br>   made to bring down the T-s from 673 to 523 K. Obtained results are
<br>   presented and discussed in this work.</td>

We observed significant PIM in Pt confined to a 2-nm interfacial region for Pt/Co77Gd23 and Pt/(Fe50Co50)(77)Gd-23 and, in both cases, the PIM was parallel to the TM sublattice rather than the RE or the net moment. Our results highlight the prominence of the d - d mediated interactions between the Pt and the constituents of the ferrimagnetic RE:TM alloys over the net macroscopic moment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Experiments are reported, which allow us to quantify the near-surface cation diffusion in (001) oriented Fe3O4 single crystals at temperatures between 470 and 770 K. Thin homoepitaxial films of magnetite, grown using isotopically labeled Fe-57, were investigated by neutron reflectivity and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. By heating the thin films in high vacuum to different temperatures for a well-defined time and determining the Fe-57 distribution along the surface normal, the diffusion lengths are obtained. For the investigated temperature range, diffusion constants of the order of 10(-20) m(2)/s are deduced. These results are important in view of near-surface mass transport induced by oxygen chemical potential differences occurring when magnetite is exposed to different gas atmospheres or by adsorbates.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Unconventional superconductivity has been suggested to be present at the interface between bismuth and nickel in thin-film bilayers. In this work, we study the structural, magnetic, and superconducting properties of sputter deposited Bi/Ni bilayers. As-grown, our films do not display a superconducting transition; however, when stored at room temperature, after about 14 days our bilayers develop a superconducting transition up to 3.8 K. To systematically study the effect of low temperature annealing on our bilayers, we perform structural characterization with x-ray diffraction and polarized neutron reflectometry, along with magnetometry and low-temperature electrical transport measurements on samples annealed at 70 degrees C. We show that the onset of superconductivity in our samples is coincident with the formation of ordered NiBi3 intermetallic alloy, a known s-wave superconductor. We calculate that the annealing process has an activation energy of (0.86 +/- 0.06) eV. As a consequence, gentle heating of the bilayers will cause formation of the superconducting NiBi3 at the Ni/Bi interface, which poses a challenge to studying any distinct properties of Bi/Ni bilayers without degrading that interface.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: MgO-based magnetic heterostructures are crucial building blocks in state-of-the-art spintronic devices. In this study, we performed thermal annealing to control the formation and distribution of FeO across the interface of a Fe-MgO system. The exchange bias phenomenon (i.e., a horizontal shift of magnetic hysteresis loops) was extended from involving only interface spins to involving the full-volume magnetization of the Fe film. The extended and reinforced exchange bias coupling in the annealed Fe/MgO(0 0 1) films can be attributed to the formation of a Fe-FeO matrix-like structure at the Fe/MgO interface under an increasing degree of interface roughness and the reduction or diffusion of oxygen from the interfacial oxides, as indicated by X-ray absorption near edge structures and X-ray reflectivity measurements. Moreover, the thermal stability of exchange bias coupling in the annealed Fe/MgO(0 0 1) films (maximum value at approximately 600 K) was considerably higher than that in conventional thin-film-based Fe/FeO structures (approximately 50 K).</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Antiferromagnets have considerable potential as spintronic materials.
<br>   Their dynamic properties include resonant modes at frequencies higher
<br>   than can be observed in conventional ferromagnetic materials. An
<br>   alternative to single-phase antiferromagnets are synthetic
<br>   antiferromagnets (SAFs), engineered structures of exchange-coupled
<br>   ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers. SAFs have significant
<br>   advantages due to the wide-ranging tunability of their magnetic
<br>   properties and inherent compatibility with current device technologies,
<br>   such as those used for Spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access
<br>   memory production. Here we report the dynamic properties of fully
<br>   compensated SAFs using broadband ferromagnetic resonance and demonstrate
<br>   resonant optic modes in addition to the conventional acoustic (Kittel)
<br>   mode. These optic modes possess the highest zero-field frequencies
<br>   observed in SAFs to date with resonances of 18 and 21 GHz at the first
<br>   and second peaks in antiferromagnetic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
<br>   (RKKY) coupling, respectively. In contrast to previous SAF reports that
<br>   focus only on the first RKKY antiferromagnetic coupling peak, we show

<br>   (LSFO) and ferromagnetic La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) on (0 0 1)-oriented

<br>   LSMO/LSFO/STO(0 0 1) and (b) LSFO/LSMO/STO(0 0 1), where the LSFO layer
<br>   is grown by molecular beam epitaxy and the LSMO layer by high oxygen

<br>   reduction in magnetization at the interface and showing no exchange
<br>   coupling. However, the exchange bias effect ( mT at 10 K) could be
<br>   realized when the interface is atomically sharp, as in LSFO/LSMO (b).
<br>   Our study therefore reveals that, even for well ordered and

It turns out that the planarity of the single-crystalline IrO2(110) film is lost in that IrO2(110) oxide domains delaminate at a cathodic potential of -0.18 V. Obviously, the electrolyte solution is able to reach the RuO2(110) layer presumably through the surface grain boundaries of the IrO2(110) layer. Subsequently, the single-crystalline RuO2(110) structure-directing template is reduced to amorphous hydrous RuO2, with the consequence that the IrO2(110) film loses partly its adhesion to the template. From in situ XRR experiments we find that the IrO2(110) film does not swell upon cathodic polarization down to -0.18 V, while from in situ SXRD experiments, the lattice constants of IrO2(110) are shown to be not affected. The rooflike mesostructure of the IrO2(110) flakes remains intact after cathodic polarization to -0.18 V, evidencing that the crystallinity of IrO2(110) is retained.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Down to a cathodic potentials of -1.20 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, the structure of IrO2(110) electrodes supported by TiO2(110) is found to be stable by in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. Such high cathodic potentials should lead to reduction to metallic Ir (Pourbaix diagram). From the IrO2 lattice parameters, determined during cathodic polarization in a H2SO4 electrolyte solution (pH 0.4), it is estimated that the unit cell volume increases by 1% due likely to proton incorporation, which is supported by the lack of significant swelling of the IrO2(110) film derived from X-ray reflectivity experiments. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that protons are incorporated into the IrO2(110) lattice below -1.0 V, although Ir remains exclusively in the IV+ oxidation state down to -1.20 V. Obviously, further hydrogenation of the lattice oxygen of IrO2(110) toward water is suppressed for kinetic reasons and hints at a rate-determining chemical step that cannot be controlled by the electrode potential.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: During the 1990s, Roger Cowley had a strong interest in the crystal and
<br>   magnetic structures of rare-earth superlattices as a means to understand
<br>   the rich and exotic magnetic properties of the rare-earth metals.
<br>   High-quality samples can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire
<br>   substrates by first depositing a thin epitaxial layer of niobium, then a
<br>   layer of yttrium or lutetium as a seed. High-resolution x-ray scattering
<br>   is an excellent probe to characterise the crystal quality and was used
<br>   to study the structure of the niobium layer. However, relatively little
<br>   attention was paid to the seed layer. This article summarises some of
<br>   the x-ray experiments performed by the Cowley group to study the
<br>   structure of epitaxial (110) niobium on (11 (2) over bar0) sapphire, and
<br>   extends the work to report some results on the structure of thin (0 00
<br>   1) yttrium seed layers. The structure of the yttrium films is shown to
<br>   have a strong dependence on the thickness of the niobium buffer, with
<br>   the buffer needing to be thicker than a critical value of similar to 80
<br>   degrees A for the formation of misfit dislocations at the Nb/Al2O3
<br>   interface before highly coherent Y films can be grown. Yttrium films
<br>   grown on Nb buffers thinner than similar to 500 degrees A show a similar
<br>   two-peak line shape in q(perpendicular to) scans through their specular
<br>   Bragg peaks to that seen in the specular Nb Bragg peaks, with a
<br>   resolution-limited feature on a broader diffuse peak. The
<br>   resolution-limited feature depends on the thickness of the yttrium film,
<br>   becoming weaker and having a stronger decay with increasing q(parallel
<br>   to) as the film thickness increases, while the width of the yttrium
<br>   broad peak evolves as the square root of the width of the niobium Bragg
<br>   peak. The data are discussed within the context of theories describing
<br>   the scattering from films with misfit dislocations.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Arranging molecules into highly symmetric, topological crystal
<br>   structures has been recognized as the best approach to functionalize
<br>   electronic properties in molecular crystals, where the constituent
<br>   molecules have been assumed to be rigid in shape. Here, in striking
<br>   contrast, we demonstrate that the molecules in a monolayer organic
<br>   crystal can undergo a significant deformation in proximity to the
<br>   substrate, which is reflected by an asymmetry in the electron density
<br>   profile. X-ray reflectivity and X-ray absorption spectroscopies in
<br>   conjunction with density-functional theory calculations reveal that the
<br>   highly planarized pi-core are deformed into a bent shape, while the bulk
<br>   lattice parameters are maintained. The molecular shape change is found
<br>   to be perfectly suppressed in a bilayer single crystal, which leads to a
<br>   40% increase in mobility in the bilayer crystal. Our finding of a

<br>   can offer possibilities for functionalizing electrical properties via

<br>   Organic molecules exhibit intrinsic semiconducting properties as well as

<br>   consequently are playing an increasing role in semiconductor
<br>   technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate that monolayers of organic

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, Hf/ZrO2-based thin films have emerged as promising candidates for ferroelectric materials in various applications.

This study demonstrates that ALPT is an effective approach to enhance and tailor the crystallization and dielectric characteristics of nanoscale thin films at a low temperature, which is highly advantageous and demanded in a variety of applications and research fields encompassing nanoelectronic, energy storage, and biomedical devices.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Multilevel remanence states have potential applications in ultra-high-density storage and neuromorphic computing. Continuous tailoring of the multilevel remanence states by spin-orbit torque (SOT) is reported in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/IrMn heterostructures. Double-biased hysteresis loops with only one remanence state can be tuned from the positively or negatively single-biased loops by SOT controlled sign of the exchange-bias field. The remanence states associated with the heights of the sub-loops are continually changed by tuning the ratio of the positively and negatively oriented ferromagnetic domains. The multilevel storage cells are demonstrated by reading the remanent Hall resistance through changing the sign and/or the magnitude of current pulse. The synaptic plasticity behaviors for neuromorphic computing are also simulated by varying the remanent Hall resistance under the consecutive current pulses. This work demonstrates that SOT is an effective method to tailor the remanence states in the double-biased heavy metal/ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic system. The multilevel-stable remanence states driven by SOT show potential applications in future multilevel memories and neuromorphic computing devices.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient information-storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions. However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high-density Neel-type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall balance (core structure [Co/Pt](n)/NiO/[Co/Pt](n)) with interfacial canted magnetizations because of interlayer ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom [Co/Pt](n)multilayers, where the Co layers in [Co/Pt](n)are always ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and easy-axis orientation. Direct experimental evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided, suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative mechanism for room-temperature spintronics.</td>

<br>   interfaces with a nanometer-thick interface layer of either nickel or

<br>   this study is to critically assess the role of the electron-phonon
<br>   coupling factor of the interlayer along with its thickness on the TBC.
<br>   It is shown that the TBC of both systems rapidly increases with the

<br>   greater than 1.5 nm. The plateau average value is 15%-25% lower than
<br>   the intrinsic TBC between the interlayer material and the diamond
<br>   substrate. This behavior and values of the TBC of both systems are in
<br>   good agreement with the predictions of the 3l-TTM. The predictability of
<br>   this model is also analyzed for a Cu interlayer inserted at Au/silicon
<br>   interfaces with thicknesses ranging from 1.5 to 20 nm. While the room
<br>   temperature TBC of this system is well described by the 3l-TTM, the
<br>   values measured at 80 K can only be predicted by the 3l-TTM, provided
<br>   that the interlayer electron-phonon coupling factor is reduced by a
<br>   factor of 2, as was experimentally observed for Ag and Au. The obtained
<br>   experimental results along with the proposed model can thus be useful

<br>   (i) some amount of interfacial reaction exists for both surface

<br>   interfaces are achieved, resulting in TBC values that are always lower
<br>   for RF-etched samples. The TBC values obtained on different substrates
<br>   allowed identifying a tendency of the TBC to scale with the maximum
<br>   transmission limit. A possible influence of the substrate was evaluated
<br>   using both the diffuse mismatch model (DMM), which predicts a strong
<br>   dependence on the substrate properties, and a newly developed approach
<br>   based on the metal irradiance (IM), which predicts no dependence on the

<br>   metal/diamond interfaces. IMSineType being the only model tested that is

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Crystallization from an amorphous precursor presents a new route to
<br>   control the properties of complex oxides by selecting their nanoscale
<br>   morphology. A key challenge in crystal growth from the amorphous form is
<br>   to select the locations of nucleation and the crystallographic
<br>   orientation of the resulting crystals. Nucleation sites for
<br>   crystallization of the prototypical perovskite complex oxide SrTiO3
<br>   (STO) from its amorphous form can be reproducibly introduced using
<br>   nanoscale seed crystals. The results of two seeding strategies are
<br>   reported here: (i) SrRuO3 (SRO) (001)-oriented nanomembranes and (ii)
<br>   STO nanocrystalline seeds. Amorphous STO crystallizes laterally over
<br>   distances of several microns from the seeds before encountering
<br>   separately nucleated crystals. The lateral crystallization rates for
<br>   both types of seeding methods are close to the values measured in
<br>   solidphase epitaxy (SPE) of STO on single-crystal substrates. The
<br>   lateral crystallization distances along different crystallographic
<br>   orientations are equal, indicating that the lateral crystallization rate
<br>   is isotropic. The isotropic crystallization suggests that the
<br>   rate-limiting steps for crystallization occur within the amorphous STO
<br>   away from the amorphous/crystalline interface. In addition to the
<br>   lateral crystallization, STO crystallizes on top of the planar SRO
<br>   nanomembrane seeds via SPE, forming partially relaxed [001]-oriented
<br>   heteroepitaxial STO layers. The in-plane orientation of laterally
<br>   crystallized STO near the SRO nanomembrane seeds exhibits overall
<br>   polycrystallinity with regions in which micron-scale grains of laterally
<br>   crystallized STO share the same in-plane orientation as the SRO
<br>   nanomembrane seeds. Crystallization from seed crystals provides
<br>   opportunities to create a wide range of other perovskite oxides in
<br>   nanoscale geometries.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic topological insulators (TIs) are an ideal playground for the
<br>   study of novel quantum phenomena building on time-reversal
<br>   symmetry-broken topological surface states. By combining different
<br>   magnetic TIs in a heterostructure, their magnetic and electronic
<br>   properties can be precisely tuned. Recently, we have combined
<br>   high-moment Dy:Bi2Te3 with high transition temperature Cr: Sb2Te3 in a
<br>   superlattice, and we found, using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
<br>   (XMCD), that long-range magnetic order can be introduced in the
<br>   Dy:Bi2Te3 layers. Accompanying first-principles calculations indicated
<br>   that the origin of the long-range magnetic order is a strong
<br>   antiferromagnetic coupling between Dy and Cr magnetic moments at the
<br>   interface extending over several layers. However, based on XMCD alone,
<br>   which is either averaging over the entire thin-film stack or is
<br>   surface-sensitive, this coupling scenario could not be fully confirmed.
<br>   Here we use polarized neutron reflectometry, which is ideally suited for
<br>   the detailed study of superlattices, to retrieve the magnetization in a
<br>   layer- and interface-resolved way. We find that the magnetization is, in
<br>   contrast to similar recent studies, homogeneous throughout the
<br>   individual layers, with no apparent interfacial effects. This finding
<br>   demonstrates that heterostructure engineering is a powerful way of
<br>   controlling the magnetic properties of entire layers, with the effects
<br>   of coupling reaching beyond the interface region.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In a Weyl orbit, the Fermi arc surface states on opposite surfaces of
<br>   the topological semimetal are connected through the bulk Weyl or Dirac
<br>   nodes. Having a real-space component, these orbits accumulate a
<br>   sample-size-dependent phase. Following recent work on the
<br>   three-dimensional Dirac semimetal cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2), we have
<br>   sought evidence for this thickness-dependent effect in quantum
<br>   oscillations and quantum Hall plateaus in (112)-oriented Cd3As2 thin
<br>   films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We compare quantum transport in
<br>   films of varying thicknesses at apparently identical gate-tuned carrier
<br>   concentrations and find no clear dependence of the relative phase of the
<br>   quantum oscillations on the sample thickness. We show that small
<br>   variations in carrier densities, difficult to detect in low-field Hall
<br>   measurements, lead to shifts in quantum oscillations that are
<br>   commensurate with previously reported phase shifts. Future claims of
<br>   Weyl orbits based on the thickness dependence of quantum transport data
<br>   require additional studies that demonstrate that these competing effects

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We present the full investigation of the atomic layer deposition (ALD)
<br>   of a mixed rhenium-aluminum oxide, namely ReAl2O3CH3, a material with

<br>   oxides, ReOx. The deposition, involving methyltrioxorhenium(VII)
<br>   (MeReO3, MTO) and trimethylaluminum (TMA), was analyzed by employing
<br>   complementary in situ diagnostic quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM),
<br>   Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and quadrupole mass
<br>   spectrometry (QMS) to explore and reveal the underlying growth mechanism
<br>   of this material. A proposed mechanism includes reductive elimination
<br>   steps, thereby creating a stable Re(III)-containing thin film, making
<br>   this ALD process unique regarding its growth. In addition, as proven by
<br>   QMS, the surface reactions include the formation of hydrogen and

<br>   extraordinarily high growth rate of 4.5 angstrom cycle(-1) at

<br>   resistivity in the range of 3.9 x 10(6) -1.5 x 10(11) Omega.cm.
<br>   Simultaneously, the TCR was lowered to about -0.014 degrees C--1,C-
<br>   making this material highly resistive over a broad temperature range and
<br>   a promising candidate for advanced detector applications, e.g.,

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We reviewed magnetic tetra metal nitrides - Fe4N and Co4N for their
<br>   structure, magnetization and the thermodynamics of phase formation.
<br>   Opposed to Fe4N, the formation of a stoichiometric Co4N turns out to be
<br>   extremely difficult. A review of the literature of Co4N compound suggest
<br>   that the experimental lattice parameter (LP) was always found to be
<br>   smaller than the theoretical predicted value. It can also be seen that
<br>   as the substrate temperature (T-s) increases, the LP of Co4N film
<br>   decreases. In this work, we deposited Co4N films using molecular beam
<br>   epitaxy (MBE), direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and high power
<br>   impulse MS (HiPIMS). Films were characterized using X-ray diffraction,
<br>   X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. It was found that at
<br>   high T-s, N out-diffusion significantly affects the growth of Co4N
<br>   phase. We found that the MBE deposited films did not show any signature
<br>   of Co4N phase when T-s < 703 K but at T-s = 703 K, the phase formed can
<br>   be assigned to fcc Co rather than Co4N. On the other hand, the dcMS and
<br>   HiPIMS grown films clearly show the presence of Co4N phase even at T-s =
<br>   300 K. Detailed analysis of Co4N films grown using dcMS and HiPIMS
<br>   reveals that HiPIMS grown films are single phase and have a denser
<br>   microstructure. The density of HiPIMS deposited film was also found to
<br>   be close to the theoretical value. Magneto optical Kerr effect and
<br>   polarized neutron reflectivity measurements were carried out to study
<br>   magnetic properties. Differences in the magnetic moment and magnetic
<br>   anisotropy were correlated with structural parameters. Obtained results

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Nanolayer stacks are technologically very relevant for current and

<br>   reflectometry (XRR). For complex stacks of multiple layers, low electron
<br>   density contrast materials, or very thin layers without any pronounced
<br>   angular minima, this requires a full modeling of the XRR data. As such a
<br>   modeling is using the thicknesses, the densities, and the roughnesses of
<br>   each layer as parameters, this approach quickly results in a large
<br>   number of free parameters. In consequence, cross correlation effects or
<br>   interparameter dependencies can falsify the modeling results. Here, the
<br>   authors present a route for validation of such modeling results which is
<br>   based on the reference-free grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF)
<br>   methodology. In conjunction with the radiometrically calibrated

<br>   that in stacks with Pt as the HM, the PMA depends crucially on the alloy
<br>   composition of the ferromagnet requiring a Co rich alloy to achieve PMA,
<br>   i.e. it is important to have a large number of Pt-Co hybrid bonds at the
<br>   interface compared to Pt-Fe hybrid bonds. In Pd/CoFeB/MgO layers, we
<br>   observe for appropriate PMA a special stripe domain configuration that
<br>   also includes circular skyrmion-like spin structures. Three different
<br>   means of selective tuning of the PMA are discussed apart from the
<br>   conventional FM thickness variation: Changing the number of repetitions
<br>   of a multilayer stack is shown to change the PMA and strong PMA is found
<br>   for certain compositions of WxTa1-x that also result in very low
<br>   coercive fields (<1 mT) of the CoFeB. The PMA has also been shown to be
<br>   tuned via annealing, very strong anisotropy fields of up to 1 T and low
<br>   pinning of domain structures were measured in W/CoFeB/MgO, making these
<br>   multilayers stacks a promising candidate for MRAM development.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The vertical composition distribution of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ)
<br>   photoactive layer is known to have dramatic effects on photovoltaic
<br>   performance in polymer solar cells. However, the vertical composition
<br>   distribution evolution rules of BHJ films are still elusive. In this
<br>   contribution, three BHJ film systems, composed of polymer donor PBDB-T,
<br>   and three different classes of acceptor (fullerene acceptor PCBM,
<br>   small-molecule acceptor ITIC, and polymer acceptor N2200) are
<br>   systematically investigated using neutron reflectometry to examine how
<br>   donor acceptor interaction and solvent additive impact the vertical
<br>   composition distribution. Our results show that those three BHJ films
<br>   possess homogeneous vertical composition distributions across the bulk

<br>   and bottom surface were observed, which could be attributed to different
<br>   repulsion, miscibility, and phase separation between the donor and
<br>   acceptor components as approved by the measurement of the donor acceptor
<br>   Flory Huggins interaction parameter chi. Moreover, the solvent additive
<br>   1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) can induce more distinct vertical composition
<br>   distribution especially in nonfullerene acceptor-based BHJ films. Thus,
<br>   higher power conversion efficiencies were achieved in inverted solar

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Spin state transition in perovskite cobaltite is delicately controlled
<br>   by the competition between exchange interaction energy and crystal-field
<br>   energy. The latter is mainly governed by the change of bond length and
<br>   bonding angle. Previous work has revealed that the electronic
<br>   configuration associated with spin state transition in LaCoO3 (LCO) thin
<br>   films can be effectively modulated by epitaxial strain. However, a
<br>   systematic study on the spin state transition of Co3+ ions in LCO films
<br>   with different crystallographic symmetry is still missing. Here, keeping
<br>   the in-plane strain unchanged, we report that the magnetization of LCO
<br>   films can be manipulated with crystallographic symmetry. The ultrathin
<br>   LCO layers, constrained by the cubic substrate, have pseudotetragonal
<br>   structure and small magnetization. Upon increasing the layer thickness,
<br>   the monoclinic structure dominates the LCO film and maximizes its
<br>   ferromagnetism. For the LCO films with a thickness beyond 35 unit cells,
<br>   the symmetry relaxes gradually towards its rhombohedral bulk form, and
<br>   meanwhile the magnetization reduces. These results highlight the
<br>   importance of spin-lattice entanglement in a ferroelastic material and
<br>   provide a concise way to maximize its functionality using symmetry
<br>   engineering.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: refnx is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis
<br>   package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on
<br>   Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based,
<br>   through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being
<br>   composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the
<br>   interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters
<br>   (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model
<br>   and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the
<br>   residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system.
<br>   Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets
<br>   and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as
<br>   probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the
<br>   system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of
<br>   components, over and above those available from the parameters alone.
<br>   Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The software offers a
<br>   choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and
<br>   gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain
<br>   Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the
<br>   model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining
<br>   parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting
<br>   scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to
<br>   facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and
<br>   subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information,
<br>   permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In this work, we measured N self-diffusion in the Co-N system and found
<br>   an unexpected result that N diffuses out almost completely around 500 K,
<br>   leaving behind fcc Co irrespective of the amount of N used to deposit
<br>   Co-N. On the other hand, in previous attempts the Co4N phase has always
<br>   been grown at 550 K or above. In view of our finding, it appears that
<br>   fcc Co could have been mistaken for Co4N, probably due to the closeness
<br>   of their lattice parameters (LP; fcc Co = 3.54 angstrom, Co4N = 3.74
<br>   angstrom). Therefore, Co4N - an interesting material for its high
<br>   spin-polarization ratio and high magnetic moment remained unexplored. By
<br>   bringing down the growth temperature, we report the growth of
<br>   stoichiometric Co4N epitaxial thin films. Films were grown using a
<br>   direct current reactive magnetron sputtering process on LaAlO3 (LAO
<br>   mismatch 1.4%) and MgO (mismatch 11.3%) substrates and their
<br>   structural and magnetic properties were studied. Precise magnetic moment
<br>   (Ms) of Co4N samples were measured using polarized neutron reflectivity
<br>   and compared with bulk magnetization results. We found that the Ms of
<br>   Co4N is higher due to a magnetovolume effect. Unlike previous findings,
<br>   we observed that substrates induce misfit strain and strain
<br>   inhomogeneity is the cause of modifications in magnetic ensemble such as
<br>   coercivity, saturation magnetization, and magnetic anisotropy. A
<br>   consequence of incoherent strain present in our samples is also
<br>   reflected in the magnetic anisotropy leading to a superposition of

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Epitaxial Fe4N thin films grown on LaAlO3 (LAO) substrate using
<br>   sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy techniques have been studied in
<br>   this work. Within the sputtering process, films were grown with
<br>   conventional direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and using a high
<br>   power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) process. Surface morphology
<br>   and depth profile studies on these samples reveal that HiPIMS deposited
<br>   film has the lowest roughness, the highest packing density, and the
<br>   sharpest interface. We found that the substrate-film interface and the
<br>   microstructure play a vital role in affecting the electronic
<br>   hybridization and magnetic properties of Fe4N films. La from the LAO
<br>   substrate and Fe from the film interdiffuse and form an undesired
<br>   interface. The magnetic moment (M-s) was compared using bulk,
<br>   element-specific and magnetic depth profiling techniques. We found that
<br>   M-s was the highest when the thickness of the interdiffused layer was
<br>   lowest and such conditions can only be achieved in the HiPIMS grown
<br>   samples. The presence of a small moment at the N site was also evidenced
<br>   by element-specific x-ray circular dichroism measurement in the HiPIMS
<br>   grown sample. A large variation in the M-s values of Fe4N films found in

<br>   interdiffused layer which is generally not expected to form in otherwise
<br>   stable oxide substrate at a low substrate temperature approximate to
<br>   675K. In addition, a consequence of substrate-film interdiffusion and
<br>   microstructure resulted in the different kinds of magnetic anisotropies
<br>   in Fe4N films grown using different techniques. A detailed investigation
<br>   of the substrate-film interface and microstructure on the magnetization
<br>   of Fe4N film is presented and discussed in this work.</td>

<br>   capability. Herein, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was optimized by introducing Ge for
<br>   high-speed and low-energy phase change memory (PCM) application. The
<br>   high speed of 10 ns and the low threshold voltage of 1.6 V have been
<br>   achieved, originating from the crystal-like octahedral motifs in the

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The interface roughness of supermirrors with m = 4 times the critical
<br>   angle of nickel has been investigated by the reflection of x-rays from
<br>   the back side of the mirrors. Reflectivity measurements from the front
<br>   side do not contain useful information about the morphology of the
<br>   layers because most photons are totally reflected from the top layer,
<br>   which has typically a thickness of approximately 80 nm. Therefore, it is
<br>   not straightforward to obtain information about the interface roughness
<br>   of the layers underneath, which are decisive for the reflectivity of the
<br>   supermirrors. In contrast, specular and off-specular measurements from
<br>   the back side provide quantitative information on the buildup of
<br>   roughness at the interfaces as well as the lateral and vertical
<br>   correlation lengths of the roughness. As the intensity of laboratory
<br>   x-ray sources is much higher than the intensity of neutron beams, it is
<br>   possible to probe up to 8 harmonics of the supermirror sequence
<br>   corresponding to m = 32. We demonstrate that the sheets caused by
<br>   resonant diffuse scattering off supermirrors with a high reflectivity
<br>   have a lower intensity and larger lateral correlation lengths than
<br>   mirrors with a low reflectivity. We show that the reflection of x-rays
<br>   from the back side of supermirrors is an alternative method for their
<br>   characterization.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a well known and handy tool to

<br>   Nevertheless, a higher-order term being proportional to M-2 and called
<br>   quadratic MOKE (QMOKE) can additionally contribute to the experimental
<br>   data. Here, we present detailed QMOKE spectroscopy measurements in the
<br>   range of 0.8-5.5 eV based on a modified eight-directional method applied
<br>   on ferromagnetic bcc Fe thin films grown on MgO substrates. From the
<br>   measured QMOKE spectra, two further complex spectra of the QMOKE

<br>   parameters, known as Delta G, denotes the strength of the QMOKE
<br>   anisotropy. Those QMOKE parameters give rise to the QMOKE tensor G,
<br>   fully describing the perturbation of the permittivity tensor in the
<br>   second order in M for cubic crystal structures. We further present
<br>   experimental measurements of ellipsometry and linear MOKE spectra,

<br>   MgO(111) buffer layer grown onto the GaN (0001) surface. The primary
<br>   purpose to introduce a 4-nm-thick buffer layer of MgO in between Fe2O3
<br>   and GaN was to stop thermal migration of Ga into the iron oxide layer.
<br>   Though such migration and successive formation of the orthorhombic
<br>   GaFeO3 was supposed earlier to be a potential trigger of the nucleation
<br>   of the isostructural epsilon-Fe2O3, the present work demonstrates that
<br>   the growth of single crystalline uniform films of epsilon ferrite by
<br>   pulsed laser deposition is possible even on the MgO capped GaN. The
<br>   structural properties of the 60-nm-thick Fe2O3 layer on MgO/GaN were
<br>   probed by electron and x-ray diffraction, both suggesting that the
<br>   growth of epsilon-Fe2O3 is preceded by formation of a thin layer of
<br>   gamma-Fe2O3. The presence of the magnetically hard epsilon ferrite was
<br>   independently confirmed by temperature dependent magnetometry
<br>   measurements. The depth-resolved x-ray and polarized neutron
<br>   reflectometry reveal that the 10 nm iron oxide layer at the interface
<br>   has a lower density and a higher magnetization than the main volume of
<br>   the epsilon-Fe2O3 film. The density and magnetic moment depth profiles

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: An atomic layer deposition (ALD) process is reported for the growth of
<br>   nanoscale PrAlO3 thin films for two-dimensional electronics and memory
<br>   device applications using tris(isopropylcyclopentadienyl)- praseodymium
<br>   (Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3)), trimethylaluminum (AlMe3), and water.
<br>   Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) was first evaluated as a precursor for the formation
<br>   of thin films of the binary oxide Pr2O3 by using water as the
<br>   coreactant. Self-limited growth of Pr2O3 was demonstrated for pulse
<br>   lengths of >= 3 s, with a growth rate of similar to 0.85 angstrom/cycle.
<br>   The ALD growth of PrAlO3 films was examined on Si, thermal SiO2, and
<br>   (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Self-limited growth was demonstrated
<br>   for Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3), AlMe3, and water at 300 degrees C by using a 1:1
<br>   ratio of the number of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses. An ALD
<br>   window was observed from 275 to 325 degrees C with a growth rate of
<br>   similar to 1.7 angstrom/cycle. The as-deposited PrAlO3 films on all
<br>   substrates were amorphous, had smooth surfaces, and contained <0.5%
<br>   carbon, as analyzed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering,
<br>   X-ray reflectivity, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively.
<br>   Films grown with a 1:1 ratio of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses were
<br>   aluminum-rich (Pr:Al similar to 1:1.2-1.4). Heating PrAlO3 layers
<br>   deposited on SrTiO3 to 800 degrees C for 3 h resulted in fully
<br>   crystallized PrAlO3 films. The crystallized PrAlO3 films were highly
<br>   (001)-oriented. The PrAlO3 00L and SrTiO3 00L reflections appeared on
<br>   the same rod of reciprocal space, further indicating that the amorphous
<br>   PrAlO3 film transforms into an epitaxial layer. The rocking curve width
<br>   of the PrAlO3 (001) reflection was 7 degrees. By contrast, PrAlO3 films
<br>   deposited on Si substrates with native oxide remained amorphous after
<br>   annealing at 1000 degrees C for 8 h. The difference in the
<br>   crystallization between PrAlO3 layers deposited on crystalline SrTiO3
<br>   and amorphous native SiO2 substrates indicates that PrAlO3 on SrTiO3
<br>   crystallized by solid-phase epitaxy, in which the nucleation and
<br>   orientation of the crystallized layer are set by the atomic
<br>   configuration at the substrate-film interface.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Recently, topotactic fluorination has become an alternative way of

<br>   engineer their electronic properties instead of the more commonly used
<br>   cation substitution. In this work, epitaxial oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta
<br>   F gamma films were synthesized via topotactic fluorination of SrMnO2.5
<br>   films using polytetrafluoroethylene as the fluorine source. Oxidized
<br>   SrMnO3 films were also prepared for comparison with the fluorinated
<br>   samples. The F content, probed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, was
<br>   systematically controlled by adjusting fluorination conditions.
<br>   Electronic transport measurements reveal that increased F content (up to
<br>   gamma = 0.14) systematically increases the electrical resistivity,
<br>   despite the nominal electron-doping induced by F substitution for O in
<br>   these films. In contrast, oxidized SrMnO3 exhibits a decreased
<br>   resistivity and conduction activation energy. A blue-shift of optical
<br>   absorption features occurs with increasing F content. Density functional
<br>   theory calculations indicate that F acts as a scattering center for
<br>   electronic transport, controls the observed weak ferromagnetic behavior
<br>   of the films, and reduces the inter-band optical transitions in the
<br>   manganite films. These results stand in contrast to bulk electron-doped
<br>   La(1-x)Ce(x)Mno(3), illustrating how aliovalent anionic substitutions
<br>   can yield physical behavior distinct from A-site substituted perovskites

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The influence of the thickness of a thin (1.5-30 nm) copper layer on the
<br>   thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at the interface between gold and
<br>   silicon, sapphire and diamond, respectively, was studied using Time
<br>   Domain Thermoreflectance. Overall, a monotonic increase in the TBC was
<br>   observed over the first 10 nm, before reaching a plateau. In some cases,
<br>   it was also observed that an interlayer reduces the TBC as compared to
<br>   the reference system. This is rationalized by assuming that the TBC
<br>   evolution as a function of the interlayer thickness is controlled by (i)
<br>   a contribution of the gold layer that has to be taken into account for
<br>   all phonons having a wavelength larger than the interlayer thickness and
<br>   (ii) a thickness-dependent resistance within the interlayer that appears
<br>   when the electron-phonon coupling is incomplete, i.e., typically over
<br>   the first 10 nm. A model is proposed in which the contribution to
<br>   thermal boundary conductance by phonons coming directly from the gold
<br>   layer is estimated using a simple Debye approximation, while the
<br>   resistance that appears within the interlayer is estimated by g(T) times
<br>   h with g(T) the electron-phonon coupling factor and h the interlayer
<br>   thickness. This results in a system with three resistances in series,
<br>   i.e., the metal-metal and metal-dielectric interfacial resistances and
<br>   the interlayer resistance, and a contribution due to phonons of the gold
<br>   layer. A reasonably good agreement between this model and experimental
<br>   data is observed. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Divalent tin is of great interest, but comes with a drawback-its

<br>   examine the change in oxidation states of Sn using a set of ALD SnOx
<br>   films annealed in different atmospheres at temperatures ranging from 350
<br>   to 650 degrees C. Although the majority of Sn in the film was
<br>   tetravalent after deposition, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray
<br>   absorption near-edge structure verified the presence of divalent Sn
<br>   after annealing in H-2, and the divalent Sn content increased as the
<br>   annealing temperature was raised. The local structures of Sn processed
<br>   under these conditions were probed using extended x-ray absorption fine
<br>   structure. Data from samples annealed in H-2 at 350, 450, and 550
<br>   degrees C were fitted well using a rutile SnO2 model; the sample
<br>   annealed in H-2 at 650 degrees C could only be fitted using a hybrid of
<br>   SnO2 and SnO models. Annealing in N-2 and O-2 resulted in tetravalent
<br>   Sn. X-ray reflectivity showed that the density of the as-deposited film
<br>   was as low as 50% of that for bulk SnO2; annealing in H-2 first
<br>   increased the critical angle, but the lowest density was found in films
<br>   annealed in H-2 at 650 degrees C. Scanning and transmission electron
<br>   microscopy analysis revealed that the as-deposited films were amorphous
<br>   whereas the annealed films underwent a dewetting process after annealing
<br>   for 30 min in H-2 at 550 degrees C; the resulting structure was
<br>   separated into tin-rich spheres with oxygen-rich outer shells and SnO

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Magnetic doping with transition metal ions is the most widely used
<br>   approach to break time-reversal symmetry in a topological insulator
<br>   (TI)-a prerequisite for unlocking the TI's exotic potential. Recently,
<br>   we reported the doping of Bi2Te3 thin films with rare-earth ions, which,
<br>   owing to their large magnetic moments, promise commensurately large
<br>   magnetic gap openings in the topological surface states. However, only
<br>   when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in angle-resolved
<br>   photoemission spectroscopy, which persists up to room temperature.
<br>   Although disorder alone could be ruled out as a cause of the topological
<br>   phase transition, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic and
<br>   electronic properties of Dy-doped Bi2Te3 remained elusive. Here, we
<br>   present an x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized neutron
<br>   reflectometry, muon-spin rotation, and resonant photoemission study of
<br>   the microscopic magnetic and electronic properties. We find that the
<br>   films are not simply paramagnetic but that instead the observed behavior
<br>   can be well explained by the assumption of slowly fluctuating,
<br>   inhomogeneous, magnetic patches with increasing volume fraction as the
<br>   temperature decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large effective
<br>   magnetization can be easily introduced by the application of moderate
<br>   magnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for
<br>   proximity coupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a
<br>   heterostructure with transition-metal-doped layers. However, the
<br>   introduction of some charge carriers by the Dy dopants cannot be
<br>   excluded at least in these highly doped samples. Nevertheless, we find
<br>   that the magnetic order is not mediated via the conduction channel in
<br>   these samples and therefore magnetic order and carrier concentration are
<br>   expected to be independently controllable. This is not generally the
<br>   case for transition-metal-doped topological insulators, and Dy doping
<br>   should thus allow for improved TI quantum devices.</td>

<br>   individual thicknesses from n = 4 to n = 48 monolayers (ML), were
<br>   deposited on epitaxial Cu/Si(001), and their microstructural evolution
<br>   and magnetic properties versus n have been studied. Elemental layering
<br>   can be seen with transmission electron microscopy down to n = 4 ML layer
<br>   thickness, although an intermixed region characterized by a finite
<br>   interface width is found to be present. This width is composed of the
<br>   interface roughness as well as the interdiffusion between layers, but
<br>   the relative contributions from these two sources could not be concluded
<br>   by the techniques used. The measured elemental layering and X-ray
<br>   reflectivity (XRR) give an upper limit to the interface width which must
<br>   be smaller than the thinnest layers, 4 ML. Electron energy loss
<br>   spectroscopy (EELS), depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
<br>   (XPS) and also XRR reveal that Fe has a higher tendency to mix with Ni
<br>   than vice versa. XPS does not have the resolution to measure this thin
<br>   elemental layering: composition variations for n = 8 ML which are

<br>   changing from (001) to (111) orientation along the growth direction. A

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The nature of magnetic correlation at low temperature in two-dimensional
<br>   artificial magnetic honeycomb lattice is a strongly debated issue. While
<br>   theoretical researches suggest that the system will develop a novel zero
<br>   entropy spin solid state as T -> 0 K, a confirmation to this effect in
<br>   artificial honeycomb lattice of connected elements is lacking. This
<br>   study reports on the investigation of magnetic correlation in newly
<br>   designed artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice of ultrasmall elements,
<br>   with a typical length of approximate to 12 nm, using neutron scattering
<br>   measurements and temperature-dependent micromagnetic simulations.
<br>   Numerical modeling of the polarized neutron reflectometry data
<br>   elucidates the temperature-dependent evolution of spin correlation in

<br>   tends to develop novel spin solid state, manifested by the alternating
<br>   distribution of magnetic vortex loops of opposite chiralities.
<br>   Experimental results are complemented by temperature-dependent
<br>   micromagnetic simulations that confirm the dominance of spin solid state
<br>   over local magnetic charge ordered state in the artificial honeycomb

<br>   magnetism of BFO/LSMO superlattices. Our results reveal that the induced
<br>   net magnetic moment in the BFO layers increases monotonically with
<br>   increasing saturation magnetization of the LSMO layers. For the
<br>   (100)-BFO/LSMO (x = 0.2) superlattice, the induced moment reaches a
<br>   record high value of similar to 2.8 mu(B)/Fe. No interfacial
<br>   magnetization is observed at the (100)-BFO/LSMO interface when LSMO is
<br>   an antiferromagnet. In contrast to (100)-oriented superlattices, no
<br>   induced moment is observed in (111)-BFO layers. Our results suggest the
<br>   interfacial structural reconstruction may not be a sufficient condition
<br>   for the enhanced net moment in BFO layer. Instead, spin canting induced
<br>   by interfacial exchange coupling is proposed in the (100)-but not in the
<br>   (111)-BFO, leading to the large net magnetization at the (100)-oriented
<br>   interface. This work further demonstrates the importance of exchange
<br>   coupling across heterointerfaces for spin canting in nominally
<br>   antiferromagnets, providing a pathway to control the magnetic properties
<br>   of artificial oxide heterostructures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Phase-change memory is one of the most attractive solutions for embedded
<br>   applications, thanks to the low cost of integration with current
<br>   manufacturing processes and the good scaling behavior. Despite intensive
<br>   research efforts that are devoted to the modification of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)
<br>   phase-change material, the obtained improvements are still
<br>   unsatisfactory for high-performance applications. In this paper,
<br>   SiC-modification is first introduced to enhance the amorphous stability
<br>   of GST without sacrificing its transition speed. Several enhancements
<br>   can be demonstrated, including better thermal stability (10-year data
<br>   retention above 120 degrees C), lower RESET voltage (about 3.0 V at 20
<br>   ns pulse width), reduced volume change (smaller than 3.0%), and
<br>   expected operation cycles (more than 1.0 x 10(5)). According to the
<br>   findings, the local bonding nature of Ge/Te atoms can be tuned by C/Si
<br>   dopants through forming CGe and SiTe bonds. Apart from strengthening the
<br>   atomic binding network for desirable data retention, the element
<br>   interdiffusion is also effectively controlled and suppressed. Together
<br>   with finer grains, smaller density change, and more uniform morphology,
<br>   the modified structure transition finally contributes to the reduced
<br>   switching voltage and long-term endurance. Hence, it is envisaged that
<br>   SiC-doped GST with such advantages will give a competitive option for
<br>   high-density and high-performance embedded memory.</td>

<br>   ultrathin films were grown on (001)-0.7Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) O-3-0.3PbTiO(3)
<br>   (PMNPT) single-crystal substrates to discriminate between the effect of

<br>   curves become loop-like, indicating that charge effects dominate strain
<br>   effects in determining the electric field that controls the transport

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Nondiffusive phonon thermal transport, extensively observed in

<br>   phonon heat conduction due to multiple scattering and interference
<br>   events of broadband phonons, by measuring the thermal conductivities of
<br>   GaAs/AlAs superlattices with ErAs nanodots randomly distributed at the
<br>   interfaces. With an increasing number of superlattice periods, the
<br>   measured thermal conductivities near room temperature increased and
<br>   eventually saturated, indicating a transition from ballistic to
<br>   diffusive transport. In contrast, at cryogenic temperatures the thermal
<br>   conductivities first increased but then decreased, signaling phonon wave
<br>   localization, as supported by atomistic Green's function simulations.

<br>   interfaces in situ provide important details of ion and solvent

<br>   02)-electrolyte interface is measured under controlled electrochemical
<br>   bias using synchrotron crystal truncation rod X-ray scattering. At

<br>   while adjacent water layers displace outwardly and became disordered.

<br>   interface is regulated by multiple electrolyte layers whose specific
<br>   structure and polarization change in response to the applied potential.
<br>   The study reveals the complex environment underlying the simplified

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the quest for materials with emergent or improved properties, an
<br>   effective route is to create artificial superstructures. Novel
<br>   properties emerge from the coupling between the phases, but the strength
<br>   of this coupling depends on the quality of the interfaces. Atomic
<br>   control of crystalline interfaces is notoriously complicated and to
<br>   elude that obstacle, we suggest here an all-amorphous design. Starting
<br>   from a model amorphous iron alloy, we locally tune the magnetic behavior
<br>   by creating boron-doped regions by means of ion implantation through a
<br>   lithographic mask. This process preserves the amorphous environment,
<br>   creating a non-topographic magnetic superstructure with smooth
<br>   interfaces and no structural discontinuities. The absence of
<br>   inhomogeneities acting as pinning centers for the magnetization reversal
<br>   is demonstrated by the formation of magnetic vortexes for ferromagnetic
<br>   disks as large as 20 mu m in diameter embedded within a paramagnetic
<br>   matrix. Rigid exchange coupling between two amorphous ferromagnetic
<br>   phases in a microstructured sample is evidenced by an investigation
<br>   involving first-order reversal curves. The sample consists of a soft
<br>   matrix with embedded elements constituting a hard phase where the
<br>   anisotropy originates from an elongated shape of the elements. We
<br>   provide an intuitive explanation for the micrometer-range exchange
<br>   coupling mechanism and discuss how to tailor the properties of
<br>   all-amorphous superstructures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: A structural study of the surface complexation of Pb(II) on the (1 (1)
<br>   over bar 02) surface of hematite was undertaken using crystal truncation
<br>   rod (CTR) X-ray diffraction measurements under in situ conditions. The
<br>   sorbed Pb was found to form inner sphere (IS) complexes at two types of
<br>   edge-sharing sites on the half layer termination of the hematite (1 (1)
<br>   over bar 02) surface. The best fit model contains Pb in distorted
<br>   trigonal pyramids with an average Pb-O bond length of 2.27(4) angstrom
<br>   and two characteristic Pb-Fe distances of 3.19(1) angstrom and 3.59(1)
<br>   angstrom. In addition, a site coverage model was developed to simulate
<br>   coverage as a function of sorbate-sorbate distance. The simulation
<br>   results suggest a plausible Pb-Pb distance of 5.42 angstrom, which is
<br>   slightly larger than the diameter of Pb's first hydration shell. This
<br>   relates the best fit surface coverage of 0.59(4) Pb per unit cell at
<br>   monolayer saturation to steric constraints as well as electrostatic
<br>   repulsion imposed by the hydrated Pb complex. Based on the structural
<br>   results we propose a stoichiometry of the surface complexation reaction
<br>   of Pb(II) on the hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface and use bond
<br>   valence analysis to assign the protonation schemes of surface oxygens.
<br>   Surface reaction stoichiometry suggests that the proton release in the
<br>   course of surface complexation occurs from the Pb-bound surface O atoms
<br>   at pH 5.5. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Rutile RuO2 is a highly active catalyst for a number of
<br>   (electro)chemical reactions in aqueous solutions or in humid
<br>   environments. However, the study of the interaction of RuO2 surfaces
<br>   with water has been confined largely to the ultrahigh vacuum environment
<br>   and to the thermodynamically stable (110) surface. In this work, we
<br>   combine ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ
<br>   surface diffraction, and density functional theory calculations to
<br>   investigate how four different facets of RuO2 interact with water under
<br>   humid and electrochemical environments. The vacant coordinatively
<br>   unsaturated Ru site (CUS) allows for the adsorption and dissociation of
<br>   water molecules. Different surfaces exhibit unique binding energetics
<br>   for -H2O and -OH and can allow for different degrees of hydrogen bonding
<br>   between the adsorbates. Consequently, the degree of water dissociation
<br>   is found to be sensitive to the surface crystallographic
<br>   orientation-being maximum for the (101) surface, followed by the (110),
<br>   (001) and (100) surfaces. This study identifies crystallographic
<br>   orientation as an important parameter to tune not only the density of
<br>   active sites but also the energetics for water dissociation; this

<br>   from oxidation leading to degradation of performance, reproducibility of

<br>   and these limit their applications. In this paper, I propose MOSPR-based
<br>   biosensors with 0 to 15 nm thick inert polycarbonate laminate plastic as
<br>   a protective layer and theoretically demonstrate the practicability of
<br>   my approach in water-medium for three different probing samples:

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Chiral domain walls in ultrathin perpendicularly magnetized layers have
<br>   a Ned structure stabilized by a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
<br>   that is generated at the interface between the ferromagnet and a heavy
<br>   metal. Different interface materials or properties are required above
<br>   and below a ferromagnetic film in order to generate the structural
<br>   inversion asymmetry needed to ensure that the DMI arising at the two
<br>   interfaces does not cancel. Here we report on the magnetic properties of
<br>   epitaxial Pt/Co/AuxPt1-x, trilayers grown by sputtering onto sapphire
<br>   substrates with 0.6 nm thick Co. As x rises from 0 to 1, a structural
<br>   inversion asymmetry is progressively generated. We characterize the
<br>   epilayer structure with x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional
<br>   transmission electron microscopy, revealing (111) stacking. The
<br>   saturation magnetization falls as the proximity magnetization in Pt is
<br>   reduced, whilst the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy K-u rises. The
<br>   micromagnetic DMI strength D was determined using the bubble expansion
<br>   technique and also rises from a negligible value when x = 0 to similar
<br>   to 1 mJ/m(2) for x = 1. The depinning field at which field-driven domain
<br>   wall motion crosses from the creep to the depinning regime rises from
<br>   similar to 40 to similar to 70 mT, attributed to greater spatial
<br>   fluctuations of the domain wall energy with increasing Au concentration.
<br>   Meanwhile, the increase in DMI causes the Walker field to rise from
<br>   similar to 10 to similar to 280 mT, meaning that only in the x = 1
<br>   sample is the steady flow regime accessible. The full dependence of
<br>   domain wall velocity on driving field bears little resemblance to the
<br>   prediction of a simple one-dimensional model, but can be described very
<br>   well using micromagnetic simulations with a realistic model of disorder.
<br>   These reveal a rise in Gilbert damping as x increases.</td>

<br>   and potentially related to the other unusual transport properties for

<br>   nm thick interface layer discovered in these films by a number of
<br>   techniques. The polarized neutron reflectometry data suggests that the
<br>   interface layer resembles GaFeO3 in composition and density and is

<br>   in-depth density variation is in agreement with the transmission
<br>   electron microscopy measurements, the layer-resolved magnetization
<br>   profiles are qualitatively consistent with the unusual wasp-waist
<br>   magnetization curves observed by superconducting quantum interference

<br>   providing a clue to the mechanisms guiding the nucleation of exotic

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We report the synthesis of SrMnO3-delta F gamma perovskite oxyfluoride
<br>   thin films using a vapor transport method to fluorinate as-grown
<br>   SrMnO2.5 epitaxial thin films. The influence of the fluoropolymer, which
<br>   acts as a fluorine vapor source, was investigated by utilizing polyvinyl
<br>   fluoride (PVF), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), and
<br>   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the reaction. The same process was
<br>   carried out with polyethylene to isolate the role of carbon in the vapor

<br>   spectroscopy, which confirmed the incorporation of F into the films and
<br>   revealed higher F concentrations in films exposed to PVF and PVDF
<br>   compared to PTFE. The c-axis parameter expands after fluorination, a
<br>   result consistent with density functional theory calculations that
<br>   attribute the volume expansion to elongated Mn-F bonds compared to
<br>   shorter Mn-O bonds. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show that
<br>   the fluorination process reduces the nominal Mn oxidation state
<br>   suggesting that F substitutes on O sites in the lattice as opposed to
<br>   filling anion vacancy sites, a finding further supported by calculated
<br>   formation energies of different F site occupancies. These results
<br>   provide insights into topochemical fluorination of perovskite oxides,

<br>   potential applications as solid oxide fuels and electrolysis cells.
<br>   However, the relatively easy transformation result from small thermal
<br>   stable energy barriers between the two phases leads to unstable the
<br>   structures. In the paper, amounts of SrCoO3-delta films have been
<br>   prepared by pulsed laser deposition at optimized growth conditions with
<br>   the temperature range of 590-720 degrees C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
<br>   results demonstrated that a phase competition emerged around 650 degrees
<br>   C. The Gibbs free energies of two phases at high temperature revealed
<br>   the difference of stability of these two phases under different growth
<br>   temperature. The optical spectroscopies and X-ray photoelectron
<br>   spectroscopies were used to verify the electronic structure and chemical
<br>   state differences between the two phases with distinct crystal
<br>   structures. (c) 2018 Author(s).</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Top surface roughness and interface roughness are one of the key

<br>   multilayer devices. It has been observed that by mixing air with argon
<br>   in sputtering ambience during deposition of Co layers, polarized neutron
<br>   reflectivity (PNR) of Co/Ti supermirror polarizers can be improved
<br>   substantially. Cross-sectional HRTEM measurement reveals that sharper
<br>   interfaces in the supermirror can be achieved in case of deposition of
<br>   the multilayer under mixed ambience of argon and air. In order to
<br>   investigate this interface modification mechanism further, in this
<br>   communication two sets of tri-layer Co/Ti/Co samples and 20-layer Co/Ti
<br>   periodic multilayer samples have been prepared; in one set all the
<br>   layers are deposited only under argon ambience and in the other set, Co
<br>   layers are deposited under a mixed ambience of argon and air. These
<br>   samples have been characterized by measuring specular and non-specular
<br>   X-ray reflectivities (GIXR) with X-rays of 1.54 angstrom wavelength and
<br>   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) with neutron of 2.5 angstrom

<br>   been supplemented by XRD and magnetic measurements on the samples. XPS

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: K2CsSb is a promising photocathode candidate to serve as an electron

<br>   (FEL) and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL). As the traditional recipe for
<br>   creation of K2CsSb photocathodes typically results in a rough surface
<br>   that deteriorates electron beam quality, significant effort has been
<br>   made to explore novel growth methods for K2CsSb photocathodes. In this
<br>   paper, a method of ternary co-evaporation of K, Cs, and Sb is described.
<br>   By using in-situ synchrotron X-ray techniques, the quality of the

<br>   photocathodes grown by this method on Si (100) and MgO (001) substrates

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The combination of charge and spin degrees of freedom with electronic
<br>   correlations in condensed matter systems leads to a rich array of
<br>   phenomena, such as magnetism, superconductivity, and novel conduction
<br>   mechanisms. While such phenomena are observed in bulk materials, a
<br>   richer array of behaviors becomes possible when these degrees of freedom
<br>   are controlled in atomically layered heterostructures, where one can
<br>   constrain dimensionality and impose interfacial boundary conditions.
<br>   Here, we unlock a host of unique, hidden electronic and magnetic phase
<br>   transitions in NdNiO3 while approaching the two-dimensional (2D) limit,
<br>   resulting from the differing influences of dimensional confinement and
<br>   interfacial coupling. Most notably, we discover a phase in fully 2D,
<br>   single-layer NdNiO3, in which all signatures of the bulk magnetic and
<br>   charge ordering are found to vanish. In addition, for
<br>   quasi-two-dimensional layers down to a thickness of two unit cells,
<br>   bulk-type ordering persists but separates from the onset of insulating
<br>   behavior in a manner distinct from that found in the bulk or thin-film
<br>   nickelates. Using resonant x-ray spectroscopies, first-principles
<br>   theory, and model calculations, we propose that the single-layer phase
<br>   suppression results from an alternative mechanism of interfacial
<br>   electronic reconstruction based on ionicity differences across the
<br>   interface, while the phase separation in multilayer NdNiO3 emerges due
<br>   to enhanced 2D fluctuations. These findings provide insights into the
<br>   intertwined mechanisms of charge and spin ordering in strongly

<br>   use atomic layering to access hidden phases.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E-ALD) technique has
<br>   demonstrated to be a suitable process for growing compound
<br>   semiconductors, by alternating the under-potential deposition (UPD) of
<br>   the metallic element with the UPD of the non-metallic element. The cycle
<br>   can be repeated several times to build up films with sub-micrometric
<br>   thickness. We show that it is possible to grow, by E-ALD, Cu2S
<br>   ultra-thin films on Ag(111) with high structural quality. They show a
<br>   well ordered layered crystal structure made on alternating
<br>   pseudohexagonal layers in lower coordination. As reported in literature
<br>   for minerals in the Cu-S compositional field, these are based on CuS3
<br>   triangular groups, with layers occupied by highly mobile Cu ions. This
<br>   structural model is closely related to the one of the low chalcocite.
<br>   The domain size of such films is more than 1000 angstrom in lateral size
<br>   and extends with a high crystallinity in the vertical growth direction
<br>   up to more than 10 nm. E-ALD process results in the growth of highly
<br>   ordered and almost unstrained ultra-thin films. This growth can lead to
<br>   the design of semiconductors with optimal transport proprieties by an
<br>   appropriate doping of the intra metallic layer. The present study
<br>   enables E-ALD as an efficient synthetic route for the growth of

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The scientific and technological interest for metal-dielectric

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The interaction of water with metal oxide surfaces plays a crucial role
<br>   in the catalytic and geochemical behavior of metal oxides. In a vast
<br>   majority of studies, the interfacial structure is assumed to arise from
<br>   a relatively static lowest energy configuration of atoms, even at room
<br>   temperature. Using hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as a model oxide, we show
<br>   through a direct comparison of in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering with
<br>   density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations that the
<br>   structure of the (1 (1) over bar 02) termination is dynamically
<br>   stabilized by picosecond water exchange. Simulations show frequent
<br>   exchanges between terminal aquo groups and adsorbed water in locations
<br>   and with partial residence times consistent with experimentally
<br>   determined atomic sites and fractional occupancies. Frequent water
<br>   exchange occurs even for an ultrathin adsorbed water film persisting on
<br>   the surface under a dry atmosphere. The resulting time averaged
<br>   interfacial structure consists of a ridged lateral arrangement of
<br>   adsorbed water molecules hydrogen bonded to terminal aquo groups.
<br>   Surface pK(a) prediction based on bond valence analysis suggests that
<br>   water exchange will influence the proton-transfer reactions underlying
<br>   the acid/base reactivity at the interface. Our findings provide
<br>   important new insights for understanding complex interfacial chemical
<br>   processes at metal oxide water interfaces.</td>

<br>   The evolution of microstructure and chemical bonds as a function of

<br>   to more favorable enthalpies of formation for ZrO2 and ZrSiO4, resulting
<br>   in passivation of the Si from the substrate. However, this layer closes
<br>   at about half of the thickness (similar to 1.7 nm) for low-O conditions
<br>   due to less oxidative conditions and less energetic particles arriving
<br>   at the sample, which leads to less intermixing via silicate formation.
<br>   In contrast, for high-O conditions, there is more ZrSiO4 and/or SiOx
<br>   formation, giving more intermixing (similar to 3.4 nm). In vacuo X-ray
<br>   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed similar
<br>   stoichiometric ZrO2 layers deposited by both conditions and a higher
<br>   interaction of the ZrO2 layer with the underlying a-Si for high-O
<br>   conditions. In addition, oxygen diffusion through low-O ZrO2 films on
<br>   a-Si has been investigated by ex situ angular-resolved XPS of samples
<br>   annealed in atmospheric oxygen. For temperatures below 400 degrees C, no
<br>   additional oxidation of the underlying a-Si was observed. This, together
<br>   with the amorphous nature and smoothness of these samples, makes ZrO2 a
<br>   good candidate as an oxidation protective layer on top of a-Si.

<br>   described as follows; when SiCl4 is reduced, a polymer-like Si form such
<br>   as Si2Cl6 is generated. This intermediate species further reacts with
<br>   other Si reactants after receiving additional electrons, which then

<br>   structural, and lattice dynamical properties, but is also the archetypal
<br>   perovskite oxide semiconductor and a foundational material in oxide
<br>   heterostructures and electronics. This has naturally focused attention
<br>   on growth, stoichiometry, and defects in SrTiO3, one exciting recent
<br>   development being such precisely stoichiometric defect-managed thin
<br>   films that electron mobilities have finally exceeded bulk crystals. This
<br>   has been achieved only by molecular beam epitaxy, however (and to a
<br>   somewhat lesser extent pulsed laser deposition (PLD)), and numerous open
<br>   questions remain. Here, we present a study of the stoichiometry,
<br>   defects, and structure in SrTiO3 synthesized by a different method, high
<br>   pressure oxygen sputtering, relating the results to electronic
<br>   transport. We find that this form of sputter deposition is also capable
<br>   of homoepitaxy of precisely stoichiometric SrTiO3, but only provided
<br>   that substrate and target preparation, temperature, pressure, and
<br>   deposition rate are carefully controlled. Even under these conditions,
<br>   oxygen-vacancy-doped heteroepitaxial SrTiO3 films are found to have
<br>   carrier density, mobility, and conductivity significantly lower than
<br>   bulk. While surface depletion plays a role, it is argued from
<br>   particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) measurements of trace impurities
<br>   in commercial sputtering targets that this is also due to deep acceptors
<br>   such as Fe at 100's of parts-per-million levels. Comparisons of PIXE
<br>   from SrTiO3 crystals and polycrystalline targets are shown to be of
<br>   general interest, with clear implications for sputter and PLD deposition

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: It has recently been demonstrated that nanoscale molecular films can
<br>   spontaneously assemble to self-generate intrinsic electric fields that
<br>   can exceed 10(8) V/m. These electric fields originate from polarization
<br>   charges in the material that arise because the films self-assemble to
<br>   orient molecular dipole moments. This has been called the spontelectric
<br>   effect. Such growth of spontaneously polarized layers of molecular
<br>   solids has implications for our understanding of how intermolecular
<br>   interactions dictate the structure of molecular materials used in a
<br>   range of applications, for example, molecular semiconductors, sensors,
<br>   and catalysts. Here we present the first in situ structural
<br>   characterization of a representative spontelectric solid, nitrous oxide.
<br>   Infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and neutron
<br>   reflectivity measurements demonstrate that polarized films of nitrous
<br>   oxide undergo a structural phase transformation upon heating above 48 K
<br>   A mean-field model can be used to describe quantitatively the magnitude
<br>   of the spontaneously generated field as a function of film-growth
<br>   temperature, and this model also recreates the phase change. This
<br>   reinforces the spontelectric model as a means of describing long-range
<br>   dipole-dipole interactions and points to a new type of ordering in
<br>   molecular thin films.</td>

<br>   of magnetization being out-of-plane. The saturation magnetization is
<br>   dependent on the doping level, and reaches from similar to 2 mu B to
<br>   almost 3 mu B per Cr ion. The transition temperature (T-c) depends
<br>   strongly on the Cr concentration and is found to increase with doping

<br>   excellent agreement with the magnetometry data. PNR studies indicate a

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: An intrinsic property of antiferromagnetic materials is the compensation

<br>   To overcome this limitation we have created artificial spin structures
<br>   by heteroepitaxy between two bulk antiferromagnets SrMnO3 and NdMnO3.
<br>   Here, we demonstrate that charge transfer at the interface results in
<br>   the creation of thin ferromagnetic layers adjacent to A-type
<br>   antiferromagnetism in thick NdMnO3 layers. A novel interference based
<br>   neutron diffraction technique and polarized neutron reflectometry are
<br>   used to confirm the presence of ferromagnetism in the SrMnO3 layers and

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 (LSFO) superlattices on

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: X-ray reflectivity is a promising technique for characterizing buried
<br>   layers and interfaces in ultrathin films because of its ability to probe
<br>   the electron density profile along the depth in a non-destructive
<br>   manner. While routine X-ray reflectivity assumes the in-plane uniformity
<br>   of the sample to be measured, it is also quite important to see buried
<br>   inhomogeneous/patterned layers and interfaces. The present paper
<br>   describes the addition of spatial resolution and imaging capability to
<br>   an X-ray reflectivity technique to visualize surfaces and buried
<br>   interfaces. To visualize quite wide viewing area size quickly, the image
<br>   reconstruction scheme has been employed instead of the scanning of
<br>   microbeam. Though the mathematics is quite close to X-ray computer
<br>   tomography, the technique gives the image contrast caused by the
<br>   difference in reflectivity at each in-plane point in the thin film
<br>   sample. By choosing a grazing angle, the image gives inhomogeneity of
<br>   X-ray reflectivity at the specific wavevector transfer. With a
<br>   collimated monochromatic synchrotron X-ray beam of 0.05mm (H) x 8mm (V),
<br>   the intensity profiles of X-ray reflection projections have been taken
<br>   at many different in-plane rotation angles, from 0 degrees to 180
<br>   degrees. We have succeeded in visualizing buried layers and interfaces
<br>   of the 8mm dia area with the spatial resolution of better than 20 mu m.
<br>   Because of the brilliance of synchrotron radiation, the typical
<br>   measuring time is shorter than 1min. Three analytical cases have been
<br>   discussed: (i) imaging of a buried layer and an interface covered by a
<br>   protection layer, (ii) distinguishing different local parts of different
<br>   thicknesses in an ultrathin film, and (iii) selective imaging of a
<br>   specific metal in the thin film form. Published by AIP Publishing.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Neutron reflectometry offers a unique opportunity for the direct

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Exchange bias and interlayer exchange coupling are interface driven
<br>   phenomena. Since an ideal interface is very challenging to achieve, a
<br>   clear understanding of the chemical and magnetic natures of interfaces
<br>   is pivotal to identify their influence on the magnetism. We have chosen
<br>   Ni80Fe20/CoO(t(CoO))/Co trilayers as a model system, and identified
<br>   non-stoichiometric Ni-ferrite and Co-ferrite at the surface and
<br>   interface, respectively. These ferrites, being ferrimagnets typically,
<br>   should influence the exchange coupling. However, in our trilayers the
<br>   interface ferrites were found not to be ferro-or ferri-magnetic; thus
<br>   having no observable influence on the exchange coupling. Our analysis
<br>   also revealed that (i) interlayer exchange coupling was present between
<br>   Ni80Fe20 and Co even though the interlayer thickness was significantly
<br>   larger than expected for this phenomenon to happen, and (ii) the
<br>   majority of the CoO layer (except some portion near the interface) did
<br>   not contribute to the observed exchange bias. We also identified that
<br>   the interlayer exchange coupling and the exchange bias properties were
<br>   not interdependent.</td>

<br>   were investigated in their hydrated and dehydrated conditions through a

<br>   backscattering, together with impedance spectroscopy. The obtained
<br>   proton conductivity and activation energy are comparable to literature
<br>   values for the bulk conductivity of similar materials, thus showing that
<br>   grain-boundary conductivity is negligible due to the high crystallinity
<br>   of the film. The results reveal an uneven proton concentration depth
<br>   profile, with the presence of a 3-4 nm thick, proton-rich layer with
<br>   altered composition, likely characterized by cationic deficiency. While
<br>   this surface layer either retains or reobtains protons after desorption
<br>   and cooling to room temperature, the bulk of the film absorbs and
<br>   desorbs protons in the expected mariner. It is suggested that the
<br>   protons in the near-surface, proton rich region are located in proton
<br>   sites characterized by relatively strong O-H bonds due to weak
<br>   hydrogen-bond interactions to neighboring oxygen atoms and that the
<br>   mobility of protons in these sites is generally lower than in proton
<br>   sites associated with stronger hydrogen bonds. It follows that strongly

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Halfmetal-semiconductor interfaces are crucial for hybrid spintronic

<br>   required for efficient spin injection. In this work we show that thin
<br>   film of half-metallic full Heusler alloy Co2FeSi0.5Al0.5 with uniform
<br>   thickness and B2 ordering can form structurally abrupt interface with
<br>   Ge(111). Atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals
<br>   that there is a small outdiffusion of Ge into specific atomic planes of
<br>   the Co2FeSi0.5Al0.5 film, limited to a very narrow similar to 1 nm
<br>   interface region. First-principles calculations show that this selective
<br>   outdiffusion along the Fe-Si/Al atomic planes does not change the
<br>   magnetic moment of the film up to the very interface. Polarized neutron
<br>   reflectivity, x-ray reflectivity and aberration-corrected electron
<br>   microscopy confirm that this interface is both magnetically and
<br>   structurally abrupt. Finally, using first-principles calculations we
<br>   show that this experimentally realised interface structure, terminated
<br>   by Co-Ge bonds, preserves the high spin polarization at the

<br>   CeO2 ultrathin films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (001) single crystals
<br>   by specular synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) under oxidizing
<br>   conditions as a first step to study the surface structure in situ. An

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We have studied the superconducting proximity effect in a series of

<br>   interfaces, effectively resulting in
<br>   superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (S-F-S) trilayers. The
<br>   thickness of top and bottom superconducting layers was found to be

<br>   showed 0-pi crossover as a function of ferromagnetic Ni thickness. The

<br>   due to the variations in densities of superconducting fluctuations in

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Perovskite oxides are a promising material class for photovoltaic and
<br>   photocatalytic applications due to their visible band gaps, nanosecond
<br>   recombination lifetimes, and great chemical diversity. However, there is
<br>   limited understanding of the link between composition and static and
<br>   dynamic optical properties, despite the critical role these properties
<br>   play in the design of light-harvesting devices. To clarify these
<br>   relationships, we systemically studied the optoelectronic properties in
<br>   La1-xSrxFeO3-delta epitaxial films, uncovering the effects of A-site
<br>   cation substitution and oxygen stoichiometry. Variable-angle
<br>   spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure static optical
<br>   properties, revealing a linear increase in absorption coefficient at
<br>   1.25 eV and a red-shifting of the optical absorption edge with
<br>   increasing Sr fraction. The absorption spectra can be similarly tuned
<br>   through the introduction of oxygen vacancies, indicating the critical
<br>   role that nominal Fe valence plays in optical absorption. Dynamic
<br>   optoelectronic properties were studied with ultrafast transient
<br>   reflectance spectroscopy, revealing similar nanosecond photoexcited
<br>   carrier lifetimes for oxygen deficient and stoichiometric films with the
<br>   same nominal Fe valence. These results demonstrate that while the static
<br>   optical absorption is strongly dependent on nominal Fe valence tuned
<br>   through cation or anion stoichiometry, oxygen vacancies do not appear to
<br>   play a significantly detrimental role in the recombination kinetics.</td>

<br>   2.65 +/- 0.03%, which is much smaller than that of Ge2Sb2Te5 (6.5%).
<br>   Phase change memory cells based on Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) material can be
<br>   reversibly switched by applying 40-400 ns width voltage pulses, and the
<br>   reset current is relatively small when comparing with the prototypical
<br>   Ge2Sb2Sb5 material. The resistance ON-OFF ratio of about 1.3 orders of
<br>   magnitude is enough for figuring ``0'' and ``1'' out. Besides,
<br>   endurance up to 4.1 x 10(4) cycles makes Zr-doped Sb2Te alloy a
<br>   potential candidate for PCM. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Thin films of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 have been deposited on single crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Due to the large lattice mismatch, three-dimensional growth is observed with strain relaxation occurring within 1-2 unit cells. The as-grown perovskite/YSZ interfaces are abrupt, despite the imperfections associated with strain relaxation. The films exhibit a single crystallographic orientation along the growth direction, with the perovskite [011] parallel to the YSZ [001]. Synchrotron diffraction and plan view transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of a columnar grain structure with the in-plane [100] and [] film directions preferentially orientated along the YSZ ⟨100⟩. The stabilization of perovskites on YSZ substrates with abrupt interfaces and a well-defined crystallographic orientation allows for the use of thin film model systems to study cathode/electrolyte interfacial reactions and morphological changes relevant to solid oxide fuel cells.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Density, elastic modulus and the pair distribution function of Co–Fe–Ta–B metallic glasses were obtained by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and measured for sputtered thin films using x-ray reflectivity, nanoindentation and x-ray diffraction using high energy photons. The computationally obtained density of 8.19 g cm−3 for Co43Fe20Ta5.5B31.5 and 8.42 g cm−3 for Co45.5Fe24Ta6B24.5, as well as the Young’s moduli of 273 and 251 GPa, respectively, are consistent with our experiments and literature data. These data, together with the good agreement between the theoretical and the experimental pair distribution functions, indicate that the model established here is useful to describe the density, elasticity and short range order of Co–Fe–Ta–B metallic glass thin films. Irrespective of the investigated variation in chemical composition, (Co, Fe)–B cluster formation and Co–Fe interactions are identified by density-of-states analysis. Strong bonds within the structural units and between the metallic species may give rise to the comparatively large stiffness.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: A direct method for the retrieval of electron density maps from surface x-ray diffraction data is presented and its performance is evaluated. The method, DCAF (difference map using the constraints of atomicity and film shift), is based on the difference map iteration scheme and uses, apart from the traditional constraints of atomicity, positivity and film thickness, a novel constraint, which we have named the ‘film shift’, whereby the real space solution is shifted up by an out-of-plane unit cell size of the underlying bulk substrate material if the topmost region of the same thickness contains insignificant electron density. This relaxes the film thickness constraint, which is necessarily loose in order to accommodate structural uncertainties at the film–substrate interface due to intermixing, roughness, and heteroepitaxial strain.
<br>
<br>DCAF’s performance was evaluated by retrieval of the electron density distribution from a real data set, recorded from a five-monolayer film of LaAlO3 on SrTiO3, which resulted in an electron density in good agreement with the previously solved structure. Importantly, the stability and reproducibility of the final solution compares favorably with constraint combinations in which the film shift projection is omitted, highlighting the power of this new method. In addition, an example of a full structural solution for a three-monolayer-thick film of La1−xSrxMnO3 on SrTiO3 is presented, where DCAF electron density retrieval followed by model building and refinement was conducted.
<br>
<br>It will be shown that DCAF can be successfully applied to thin films for retrieving physically meaningful electron densities, and that it can also serve as a starting point for subsequent structure refinement.</td>

The structural quality of the samples was investigated by x-ray reflectometry, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The results show a strong dependence of the structural quality on the growth temperature. Although good epitaxial layers are obtained at 165 °C, the sample does not exhibit any superlattice diffraction peaks. This effect is shown to be related to a continuous variation of the distance between the Fe layers as well as between the MgO layers.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The structural properties of a tetragonally distorted Fe1−xCox alloy, in the form of Fe1−xCox/Pt(001) superlattices with x = 0.64, have been investigated experimentally. The study follows recent theoretical predictions on the enhanced uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy of such alloys with specific combinations of chemical composition and tetragonal distortion. The ratio between out-of-plane and in-plane lattice parameters in the Fe0.36Co0.64 layers, c/a, was found to vary between 1.18 and 1.31, depending on the thickness ratio between the alloy and the spacer. This covered the range of interest c/a = 1.20–1.25 in the previous calculations and should be compared to c/a = 1 in the original bcc alloy lattice. Simulations of x-ray diffraction patterns as well as density functional calculations support the derivation of the Fe0.36Co0.64 lattice parameters.</td>
