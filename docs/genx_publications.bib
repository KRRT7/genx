Title = {Double is better: achieving an oxide solar-blind UV detector with
   ultrahigh detectivity and fast-refreshing capability},

Abstract = {Oxygen vacancy (VO) defects are common in oxide semiconductors, which
   are generally believed to be double-edged in detectors. They contribute
   to a photo gain effect and consequently high responsivity. However, VO
   defects typically result in high dark current and long persistent
   photoconductivity (PPC), severely affecting the weak-light detecting and
   quick refreshing abilities. Here, a simple two-terminal architecture is
   constructed on amorphous Ga2O3 double layers. By adopting a periodic
   bias-switching working method, we found that the PPC is stably
   suppressed and a robustly high refresh rate is achieved, accompanied
   with the ultra-high photo-to-dark current ratio (> 109), detectivity
   (8.7x10(17 )Jones) and UV-vis rejection ratio (> 10(8)). The combination
   of VO- gradient double-layer structure and new working method enables an
   unimpeded transportation of photo generated electrons under light
   illumination and a swift block of the trap-released electrons in dark.
   The methodology may be hopefully extended to other oxide semiconductors
   for high-performance photodetection.},

Abstract = {The influence and interaction of the ionizable amphiphilic drug
   amitriptyline hydrochloride (AMT) on a
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) phospholipid bilayer
   supported on a silica surface have been investigated using a combination
   of neutron reflectometry and quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation monitoring. Adding AMT solutions with concentrations 3, 12,
   and 50 mM leaves the lipid bilayer mainly intact and we observe most of
   the AMT molecules attached to the head-group region of the outer bilayer
   leaflet. Virtually no AMT penetrates into the hydrophilic head-group
   region of the inner leaflet close to the silica surface. By adding 200
   mM AMT solution, the lipid bilayer dissolved entirely, indicating a
   threshold concentration for the solubilization of the bilayer by AMT.
   The observed threshold concentration is consistent with the observation
   that various bilayer structures abruptly transform into mixed AMT-DOPC
   micelles beyond a certain AMT-DOPC composition. Based on our
   experimental observations, we suggest that the penetration of drug into
   the phospholipid bilayer, and subsequent solubilization of the membrane,
   follows a two-step mechanism with the outer leaflet being removed prior
   to the inner leaflet.},

Title = {Kinetics and the crystallographic structure of bismuth during
   liquefaction and solidification on an insulating substrate},
Journal = {SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {723},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Here we study the kinetics of liquefaction and solidification of thin
   bismuth films grown on an insulating substrate by pulsed laser
   deposition (PLD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and investigated by in
   situ electron and X-ray diffraction. By PLD, we can grow films similar
   to those obtained using MBE, studied by ex-situ AFM, KPFM, XRR, and XRD.
   The liquefaction-solidification transition is monitored in real-time by
   RHEED and synchrotron XRD, observing thereby the dewetting phenomenon
   and the formation of spherical droplets which size depends on the
   initial film thickness. Studying this phase transition in more detail,
   we find abrupt liquefaction and solidification, resulting in formation
   of the nanodots oriented with the (110) crystallographic plane parallel
   to the substrate. Furthermore, by analysis of the recorded specular
   diffraction rods, we propose growth by initial deposition, followed by a
   transformation into nandots, followed by further deposition. Overall, we
   demonstrate that controlling the growth scenario for Bi nanostructures,
   here shown by PLD and MBE, one is able to steer its resulting shape,
   size and corresponding (materials) properties.},

Title = {Nanoscale Structure of Langmuir-Blodgett Film of Bent-Core Molecules},
Journal = {NANOMATERIALS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Bent-core mesogens (BCMs) are a class of thermotropic liquid crystals
   featuring several unconventional properties. However, the interpretation
   and technological exploitation of their unique behavior have been
   hampered by the difficulty of controlling their anchoring at surfaces.
   To tackle this issue, we report the nanoscale structural
   characterization of BCM films prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett
   technique. Even though BCMs are quite different from typical amphiphilic
   molecules, we demonstrate that stable molecular films form over water,
   which can then be transferred onto silicon substrates. The combination
   of Brewster angle microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray
   reflectivity measurements shows that the molecules, once transferred
   onto a solid substrate, form a bilayer structure with a bottom layer of
   flat molecules and an upper layer of upright molecules. These results
   suggest that Langmuir-Blodgett films of BCMs can provide a useful means
   to control the alignment of this class of liquid crystals.},

Title = {Giant Orbital Anisotropy with Strong Spin-Orbit Coupling Established at
   the Pseudomorphic Interface of the Co/Pd Superlattice},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Orbital anisotropy at interfaces in magnetic heterostructures has been
   key to pioneering spin-orbit-related phenomena. However, modulating the
   interface's electronic structure to make it abnormally asymmetric has
   been challenging because of lack of appropriate methods. Here, the
   authors report that low-energy proton irradiation achieves a strong
   level of inversion asymmetry and unusual strain at interfaces in
   {[}Co/Pd] superlattices through nondestructive, selective removal of
   oxygen from Co3O4/Pd superlattices during irradiation. Structural
   investigations corroborate that progressive reduction of Co3O4 into Co
   establishes pseudomorphic growth with sharp interfaces and atypically
   large tensile stress. The normal component of orbital to spin magnetic
   moment at the interface is the largest among those observed in layered
   Co systems, which is associated with giant orbital anisotropy
   theoretically confirmed, and resulting very large interfacial magnetic
   anisotropy is observed. All results attribute not only to giant orbital
   anisotropy but to enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling owing to the
   pseudomorphic nature at the interface. They are strongly supported by
   the observation of reversal of polarity of temperature-dependent
   Anomalous Hall signal, a signature of Berry phase. This work suggests
   that establishing both giant orbital anisotropy and strong spin-orbit
   coupling at the interface is key to exploring spintronic devices with
   new functionalities.},

Title = {Silicon carbide synthesized by RF magnetron sputtering in the
   composition of a double layer antireflection coating SiC/MgF2},
Journal = {OPTICAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, the optimal thickness of SiC film for an antireflection
   coating was determined by computer simulations using Lumerical FTDT and
   SCOUT software. The simulation was carried out for the SiC/MgF2 system,
   where silicon carbide films were deposited at a magnetron power of 100,
   150, 200, 250 W, while the thickness of the magnesium fluoride films
   remained unchanged and amounted to 130 nm. The simulation results showed
   that the optimal parameters for the synthesis of SiC antireflection
   layer are 100 W/50 nm. With these parameters, the reflection is less
   than 3\% in the widest wavelength range of 475-1020 nm. The dependence
   of the physical properties of the synthesized films on the power of the
   magnetron is investigated. Using reflection and transmission
   spectroscopy it was experimentally revealed that a decrease in the
   magnetron power from 250 to 100 W leads to a decrease in the refractive
   index. According to our results the best antireflection effect can be
   achieved with SiC/MgF2 coatings when SiC films are deposited at 100 W
   magnetron power. The reflectance spectra are consistent with the
   simulation spectra, especially in the 475-1020 nm range, where the
   surface reflects only 0.2-3.0\% of the incident light. The obtained
   results are explained by the correlation between the structural
   properties, composition of amorphous silicon carbide films and
   antireflection properties.},

Title = {Influence of deuterium-induced volume changes on optical transmission in
   Fe/V (001) and Cr/V (001) superlattices},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Number = {19},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {The deuterium-induced changes of the optical transmission in Fe/V (001)
   and Cr/V (001) superlattices are found experimentally to be dominated by
   the volume changes of the vanadium layers and thus indirectly linked to
   concentration. The deuterium-induced expansion is 67\% larger in Cr/V
   2/14 monolayers (ML) as compared to Fe/V 2/14 ML. This large difference
   can be explained by a difference in the site of deuterium from
   tetrahedral in Fe/V to octahedral in Cr/V. First-principles calculations
   based on this assumption give quantitative agreement with both the
   measured optical transmission and the deuterium-induced expansion
   coefficient. Placing hydrogen in the middle of the vanadium layers
   results in total energies at 0 K that favor tetrahedral occupancy at low
   concentrations, although the energy difference is of the order of the
   thermal energy available in the experiments. Hence small changes in
   strain, defect concentration, and/or vibrational spectrum of the
   superlattices may tip the balance to octahedral occupancy at low
   concentrations. Given this link to concentration and the linear scaling,
   optical transmission can, therefore, be used in a straightforward way to
   obtain pressure-composition isotherms also in thin metal films that do
   not undergo metal-insulator transitions upon hydrogenation.},

Abstract = {Si1-xGex with Ge contents higher than x = 0.5 is expected to boost
   on-current and improve reliability of p-channel
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (pMOS) devices. However, unavoidable GeOx
   formation at the high-kappa/Si1-xGex interface with high Ge-contents
   (HGC) has caused high interfacial trap density, posing a challenge for
   employing the HGC Si(1-x)Ge(x )as the channel in sub-3 nm complementary
   MOS technology. In this work, we have deposited epitaxial Si (epi-Si) of
   six monolayer thickness on Si1-xGex at temperatures of 260-280 degrees C
   to minimize Ge diffusion and segregation. Si1-xGex layers with a wide
   range of HGC (0.5 < x <= 0.8) were grown to investigate the
   effectiveness of the epi-Si on the Si1-xGex To minimize the GeOx
   formation caused by the oxidation of the segregated Ge on the epi-Si
   surface, HfO2 was subsequently deposited via e-beam evaporation on the
   epi-Si. The measurements using reflection high-energy electron
   diffraction, high-resolution synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction,
   and scanning transmission electron microscopy with high-angle
   annulardark-field imaging have revealed the high crystallinity of the
   epi-Si, the Si1-xGex layers, and abrupt interfaces of the
   high-kappa/epi-Si/Si1-xGex layers. The well-controlled interfaces have
   enabled the achievement of low interfacial trap densities (D-it) of
   (3-6) x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) in these high-kappa/epi-Si/(HGC)Si1-xGex
   samples. The minimum D-it values remained at 3 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2)
   regardless of the Ge content, confirming the effective passivation of
   the low-temperature deposited epi-Si. By extracting the effective charge
   sheet densities for the Si1-xGex gate stacks via examination of
   capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis with decreasing stress voltage in
   the accumulation region of the MOS capacitors, we have attained very
   high acceleration factors of 8-12, indicating high reliability of the
   HfO2/epi-Si/SiGe pMOS gate stacks.},

Abstract = {We report on the electronic and magnetic properties of

   Polycrystalline Nb thin films (5 to 50 nm thick) were shown to possess

   These properties improved during ex-situ annealing, resulting in Delta

   pre-annealed T-c) and 0.8 (similar to 60\% of the pre-annealed RRR)

Abstract = {The temperature-dependent layer-resolved structure of 3 to 44 unit cell
   thick SrRuO3 (SRO) films grown on Nb-doped SrTiO3 substrates is
   investigated using a combination of high-resolution synchrotron x-ray
   diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy to understand the
   role that structural distortions play in suppressing ferromagnetism in
   ultra-thin SRO films. The oxygen octahedral tilts and rotations and Sr
   displacements characteristic of the bulk orthorhombic phase are found to
   be strongly dependent on temperature, the film thickness, and the
   distance away from the film-substrate interface. For thicknesses, t,
   above the critical thickness for ferromagnetism (t > 3 uc), the
   orthorhombic distortions decrease with increasing temperature above T-C.
   Below T-C, the structure of the films remains constant due to the
   magneto-structural coupling observed in bulk SRO. The orthorhombic
   distortions are found to be suppressed in the 2-3 interfacial layers due
   to structural coupling with the SrTiO3 substrate and correlate with the
   critical thickness for ferromagnetism in uncapped SRO films. (C) 2022

Abstract = {Magnetic systems exhibiting spin-canted states have garnered much
   attention recently for their promising rich exotic properties driven by
   the real-space spin textures and competing magnetic orders. In this
   study, we present the structural and magnetic properties of hexagonal 60
   nm MnPtGa epitaxial thin films grown by magnetron sputtering on
   Al2O3(0001) single-crystalline substrates. The MnPtGa film crystallizes
   in the centrosymmetric P6(3)/mmc (No. 194) space group, showing
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along the c-axis, with a Curie
   temperature T-C = 263 K. In addition, the MnPtGa film undergoes a spin
   reorientation transition at T-sr = 160 K. We investigated the MnPtGa
   magnetic ground states using single-crystal neutron diffraction. A
   structurally forbidden (001) magnetic Bragg reflection emerges below
   T-sr, indicating the existence of a spin-canted state, where the
   magnetic moments align ferromagnetically perpendicular to the basal

Title = {In Situ Reflectometry and Diffraction Investigation of the Multiscale
   Structure of p-Type Polysilicon Passivating Contacts for c-Si Solar
   Cells},

Abstract = {The integration of passivating contacts based on a highly doped
   polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer on top of a thin silicon oxide
   (SiOx) layer has been identified as the next step to further increase
   the conversion efficiency of current mainstream crystalline silicon
   (c-Si) solar cells. However, the interrelation between the final
   properties of poly-Si/SiOx contacts and their fabrication process has
   not yet been fully unraveled, which is mostly due to the challenge of
   characterizing thin-film stacks with features in the nanometric range.
   Here, we apply in situ X-ray reflectometry and diffraction to
   investigate the multiscale (1 angstrom-100 nm) structural evolution of
   poly-Si contacts during annealing up to 900 degrees C. This allows us to
   quantify the densification and thinning of the poly-Si layer during
   annealing as well as to monitor the disruption of the thin SiOx layer at
   high temperature >800 degrees C. Moreover, results obtained on a broader
   range of thermal profiles, including firing with dwell times of a few
   seconds, emphasize the impact of high thermal budgets on poly-Si
   contacts' final properties and thus the importance of ensuring a good
   control of such high-temperature processes when fabricating c-Si solar
   cells integrating such passivating contacts. Overall, this study
   demonstrates the robustness of combining different X-ray elastic
   scattering techniques (here XRR and GIXRD), which present the unique
   advantage of being rapid, nondestructive, and applicable on a large
   sample area, to unravel the multiscale structural evolution of poly-Si
   contacts in situ during high-temperature processes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},

Abstract = {The effect of in situ annealing is investigated in Gd0.1Ca0.9MnO3 (GCMO)
   thin films in oxygen and vacuum atmospheres. We show that the reduction
   of oxygen content in GCMO lattice by vacuum annealing induced more
   oxygen complex vacancies in both subsurface and interface regions and
   larger grain domains when compared with the pristine one. Consequently,
   the double exchange interaction is suppressed and the
   metallic-ferromagnetic state below Curie temperature turned into
   spin-glass insulating state. In contrast, the magnetic and resistivity
   measurements show that the oxygen treatment increases ferromagnetic
   phase volume, resulting in greater magnetization (M (S)) and improved
   magnetoresistivity properties below Curie temperature by improving the
   double exchange interaction. The threshold field to observe the training
   effect is decreased in oxygen treated film. In addition, the positron
   annihilation spectroscopy analysis exhibits fewer open volume defects in
   the subsurface region for oxygen treated film when compared with the
   pristine sample. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the oxygen
   treated film with significant spin memory and greater magnetoresistance
   can be a potential candidate for the future memristor applications.},

Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {With the scaling of lateral dimensions in advanced transistors, an
   increased gate capacitance is desirable both to retain the control of
   the gate electrode over the channel and to reduce the operating
   voltage'. This led to a fundamental change in the gate stack in 2008,
   the incorporation of high-dielectric-constant HfO2 (ref. 2 ), which
   remains the material of choice to date. Here we report HfO2-ZrO2
   superlattice heterostructures as a gate stack, stabilized with mixed
   ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order, directly integrated onto Si
   transistors, and scaled down to approximately 20 angstroms, the same
   gate oxide thickness required for high-performance transistors. The
   overall equivalent oxide thickness in metal-oxide-semiconductor
   capacitors is equivalent to an effective SiO2 thickness of approximately
   6.5 angstroms. Such a low effective oxide thickness and the resulting
   large capacitance cannot be achieved in conventional HfO2-based
   high-dielectric-constant gate stacks without scavenging the interfacial
   SiO2, which has adverse effects on the electron transport and gate
   leakage current'. Accordingly, our gate stacks, which do not require
   such scavenging, provide substantially lower leakage current and no
   mobility degradation. This work demonstrates that ultrathin ferroic
   HfO2-ZrO2 multilayers, stabilized with competing
   ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order in the two-nanometre-thickness
   regime, provide a path towards advanced gate oxide stacks in electronic
   devices beyond conventional HfO2-based high-dielectric-constant
   materials.},

   of various thin films on silicon substrates, the pipeline reliably finds
   an LMS minimum very close to a fit produced by a human researcher with
   the application of physical knowledge and carefully chosen boundary
   conditions. The differences between simulated and experimental data and
   their implications for the training and performance of neural networks
   are discussed. The experimental test set is used to determine the

   of the neural network are leveraged to compensate for systematic errors

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Damping and spin transport in spintronic multilayered systems continues
   to be a topic of active research. The enhancement of damping in
   ferromagnet (FM)/spacer layer (SL)/heavy-metal (HM) thin-film systems
   was studied for Co25Fe75/SL/Pt with a nonmagnetic (NM) SL of either Au
   or Cu with variable thickness, in order to understand the correlation
   with proximity-induced magnetism (PIM) in the HM. Structural, PIM and
   magnetic damping measurements were undertaken on the same samples.
   Specifically, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, element specific x-ray
   magnetic reflectivity and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Pt
   and Au L-3 edges, and ferromagnetic resonance methods were used. With
   increasing thickness of a Cu or Au SL directly between the FM and the Pt
   layer, the Pt PIM and the damping both fall rapidly, with a relationship
   between damping and PIM that depends on the SL material. The PIM
   observed in the Au layer showed a complex dependence on the layer
   thickness, suggesting some hybridization with the Pt. The role of the
   number and location of interfaces on the damping was demonstrated with
   the addition of a SL within the Pt layer, which showed that the specific
   details of the NM/HM interface also affects the damping. The insertion
   of a Cu SL within the Pt showed a measurable increase in the overall
   enhancement of the damping while the insertion of a Au SL into Pt had
   almost no effect on the damping. Together these results demonstrate the
   role of both PIM and of additional interfaces in the enhancement of
   damping in FM/HM systems, which is not fully accounted for by existing
   theory.},

Abstract = {The detection and quantification of hydrogen is becoming increasingly
   important in research on electronic materials and devices, following the
   identification of the hydrogen content as a potent control parameter for
   the electronic properties. However, establishing quantitative
   correlations between the hydrogen content and the physical properties of
   solids remains a formidable challenge. Here we report neutron
   reflectometry experiments on 50 nm thick niobium films during hydrogen
   loading, and show that the momentum-space position of a prominent
   waveguide resonance allows tracking of the absolute hydrogen content
   with an accuracy of about one atomic percent on a timescale of less than
   a minute. Resonance-enhanced neutron reflectometry thus allows fast,
   direct, and non-destructive measurements of the hydrogen concentration
   in thin-film structures, with sensitivity high enough for real-time
   in-situ studies.

Abstract = {In this work, we investigated the effect of Ag doping (2-20 at.\%) on

Journal = {SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {433},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Amorphous boron carbide (B4C) thin films are by far the most popular
   form for the neutron converting layers in the 10B-based neutron
   detectors, which are a rising trend in detector technologies in response
   to the increasing scarcity and price of( 3)He, the standard material for
   neutron detection. The microstructure of the B4C films is closely
   related to the important properties, e.g. density and adhesion, for the
   converting layers, which eventually affect the detection efficiency and
   the long-term stability of the detectors. To study the influence from
   substrates of different roughness and materials, the B4C films were
   deposited on polished Si substrates with Al, Ti, and Cu buffer layers
   and unpolished Si, Al, Ti, and Cu substrates by direct current magnetron
   sputtering at a substrate temperature of 623 K. The tapered columnar
   grains and nodular defects, generally observed in SEM images, indicated
   a strong shadowing effect where voids were introduced around the grains.
   The change in the grain size did not show a direct dependence to the
   substrate roughness, acquired from the surface profile, nor to the mass
   density of the films, obtained from reflectivity patterns. However,
   films with non-uniform size of columnar grains were deposited on
   substrates with high skewness, leading to a drop of mass density
   from-95\% down to-70\% of tabulated bulk density. On the other hand,
   similar microstructures and mass density were obtained from the films
   deposited on Al, Ti, and Cu of different roughness and good adhesion
   were observed from cross-cut adhesion tests, showing the reliability of
   sputtering deposited B4C films on common structural materials in neutron
   detectors.},

Abstract = {Combinatorial synthesis via a continuous composition spread is an
   excellent route to develop thin-film libraries as it is both time- and
   cost-efficient. Creating libraries of functional, multicomponent,
   complex oxide films requires excellent control over the synthesis
   parameters combined with high-throughput analytical feedback. A
   reliable, high-throughput, in-situ characterization analysis method is
   required to meet the crucial need to rapidly screen materials libraries.
   Here, we report on the combination of two in-situ techniques-(a)
   Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) for heteroepitaxial
   characterization and a newly developed compositional analysis technique,
   low-angle x-ray spectroscopy (LAXS), to map the chemical composition
   profile of combinatorial heteroepitaxial complex oxide films deposited
   using a continuous composition spread method via pulsed laser
   deposition. This is accomplished using a unique state-of-the-art
   combinatorial growth system with a fully synchronized four-axis
   mechanical substrate stage without shadow masks, alternating acquisition
   of chemical compositional data using LAXS at various different positions
   on the similar to 41 mm x 41mm range and sequential deposition of
   multilayers of SrTiO3 and SrTi0.8RU0.2O3 on a 2-inch (50.8 mm) LaAlO3
   wafer in a single growth run. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry
   (RBS) is used to calibrate and validate the compositions determined by
   LAXS. This study shows the feasibility of combinatorial synthesis of
   heteroepitaxial, functional complex oxide films at wafer-scale via two
   essential in-situ characterization tools-RHEED for structural analysis
   or heteroepitaxy and LAXS for compositional characterization. This is a

Abstract = {The interactions between organic donor and acceptor molecules and the
   related charge transfer (CT) effects are of great interest in organic
   optoelectronics. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of
   cocrystal formation and charge transfer effects in weakly interacting
   organic semiconductor mixtures. As a model system, we choose
   dinaphthothienothiophene (DNTT) as a donor molecule and two different
   perylene diimide derivatives (PTCDI-C-8-CN2 and PDIF-CN2) as acceptors,
   which differ in the fluorination of the side chains in the imide
   position. Experimentally, both systems show a small ground-state CT
   governed by hybridized HOMO-1 and LUMO+1 levels. In contrast, the
   respective HOMO and LUMO levels of the complex are localized on the
   acceptor and donor molecule. This leads to the observation of a nearly
   pure charge transfer excitation from the acceptor to the donor in the
   absorption spectra. We discuss the general impact of localized HOMO and
   LUMO levels on the optoelectronic properties in CT complexes dependent
   on comparison with first-principles calculations based on density
   functional theory and many-body perturbation theory.},

Title = {Elucidating proximity magnetism through polarized neutron reflectometry
   and machine learning},
Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Polarized neutron reflectometry is a powerful technique to interrogate
   the structures of multilayered magnetic materials with depth sensitivity
   and nanometer resolution. However, reflectometry profiles often inhabit
   a complicated objective function landscape using traditional fitting
   methods, posing a significant challenge for parameter retrieval. In this
   work, we develop a data-driven framework to recover the sample
   parameters from polarized neutron reflectometry data with minimal user
   intervention. We train a variational autoencoder to map reflectometry
   profiles with moderate experimental noise to an interpretable,
   low-dimensional space from which sample parameters can be extracted with
   high resolution. We apply our method to recover the scattering length
   density profiles of the topological insulator-ferromagnetic insulator
   heterostructure Bi2Se3/EuS exhibiting proximity magnetism in good
   agreement with the results of conventional fitting. We further analyze a
   more challenging reflectometry profile of the topological
   insulator-antiferromagnet heterostructure (Bi,Sb)(2)Te-3/Cr2O3 and
   identify possible interfacial proximity magnetism in this material. We
   anticipate that the framework developed here can be applied to resolve
   hidden interfacial phenomena in a broad range of layered systems. (C)

Abstract = {We report on the formation of Ag-containing ZrCuAlNi thin film metallic
   glass (nano)composites by a hybrid direct-current magnetron sputtering
   and high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering process. The effects of Ag

   applying a substrate bias potential did not strongly affect the
   morphological evolution of the films, the Ag content dictated the size
   and distribution of Ag surface segregations. The films deposited at low
   temperatures were characterized by strong surface segregations, formed
   by coalescence and Ostwald ripening, while the volume of the films
   remained featureless. At higher deposition temperature, elongated Ag
   segregations were observed in the bulk and a continuous Ag layer was
   formed at the surface as a result of thermally enhanced surface
   diffusion. While microstructural observations have allowed identifying
   both surface and bulk segregations, an indirect method for detecting the
   presence of Ag segregations is proposed, by measuring the electrical
   resistivity of the films.},

Abstract = {Producing ultrathin light absorber layers is attractive towards the

   heights from 5 - 15 nm with sub-50 nm diameters were engineered by block

   alumina (Al2O3) spacer layer and a reflecting Au mirror, in a
   film-coupled nanoparticle design. The BCP nanopatterning strategy to
   produce desired heights of Au nanoresonators was tailored to achieve
   near-perfect absorption at approximate to 600 nm. The experimental

Abstract = {We have prepared a series of ampholytic polymer films, using a
   self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization (SI-PGP) method to
   sequentially polymerize first anionic (deuterated methacrylic acid
   (dMAA)) and thereafter cationic (2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA))
   monomers to investigate the SI-PGP grafting process. Dry films were
   investigated by ellipsometry, X-ray, and neutron reflectometry, and
   their swelling was followed over a pH range from 4.5 to 10.5 with
   spectroscopic ellipsometry. The deuterated monomer allows us to separate
   the distributions of the two components by neutron reflectometry. Growth
   of both polymers proceeds via grafting of solution-polymerized fragments
   to the surface, and also the second layer is primarily grafted to the
   substrate and not as a continuation of the existing chains. The polymer
   films are stratified, with one layer of near 1:1 composition and the
   other layer enriched in one component and located either above or below
   the former layer. The ellipsometry results show swelling transitions at
   low and high pH but with no systematic variation in the pH values where
   these transitions occur. The results suggest that grafting density in
   SI-PGP-prepared homopolymers could be increased via repeated
   polymerization steps, but that this process does not necessarily
   increase the average chain length.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Pages = {73-77},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Magnetic phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and indispensable for modern
   science and technology, but it is notoriously difficult to change the
   magnetic order of a material in a rapid way. However, if a thin nickel
   film is subjected to ultrashort laser pulses, it loses its magnetic
   order almost completely within femtosecond timescales(1). This
   phenomenon is widespread(2-7) and offers opportunities for rapid
   information processing(8-11) or ultrafast spintronics at frequencies
   approaching those of light(8,9,12). Consequently, the physics of
   ultrafast demagnetization is central to modern materials
   research(1-7,13-28), but a crucial question has remained elusive: if a
   material loses its magnetization within mere femtoseconds, where is the
   missing angular momentum in such a short time? Here we use ultrafast
   electron diffraction to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous,
   long-lasting, non-equilibrium population of anisotropic high-frequency
   phonons that appear within 150-750 fs. The anisotropy plane is
   perpendicular to the direction of the initial magnetization and the
   atomic oscillation amplitude is 2 pm. We explain these observations by
   means of circularly polarized phonons that quickly absorb the angular
   momentum of the spin system before macroscopic sample rotation. The time
   that is needed for demagnetization is related to the time it takes to
   accelerate the atoms. These results provide an atomistic picture of the
   Einstein-de Haas effect and signify the general importance of polarized
   phonons for non-equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions.},

Journal = {AIP ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The odd parity nature of 4f states characterized by strong spin-orbit
   coupling and electronic correlations has led to a search for novel
   topological phases among rare earth compounds, such as Kondo systems,
   heavy Fermions, and homogeneous mixed-valent materials. Our target
   system is thulium telluride thin films whose bandgap is expected to be
   tuned as a function of lattice parameter. We systematically investigate
   the growth conditions of TmxTey thin films on SrF2 (111) substrates by
   molecular beam epitaxy. The ratio between Te and Tm supply was precisely
   tuned, resulting in two different crystalline phases, which were
   confirmed by x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. By
   investigating the crystalline quality as a function of the substrate
   temperature, the optimal growth conditions were identified for the
   desired Tm1Te1 phase. Additional low energy electron diffraction and
   reflective high energy electron diffraction measurements confirm the
   epitaxial growth of TmTe layers. X-ray reflectivity measurements
   demonstrate that homogeneous samples with sharp interfaces can be
   obtained for varied thicknesses. Our results provide a reliable guidance
   to prepare homogeneous high-quality TmTe thin films and thus serve as a
   basis for further electronic investigations. (c) 2022 Author(s). All

Title = {Sequential Infiltration Synthesis into Maltoheptaose and Poly(styrene):
   Implications for Sub-10 nm Pattern Transfer},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Vapor phase infiltration into a self-assembled block copolymer (BCP) to
   create a hybrid material in one of the constituent blocks can enhance
   the etch selectivity for pattern transfer. Multiple pulse infiltration
   into carbohydrate-based high-chi BCP has previously been shown to enable
   sub-10 nm feature pattern transfer. By optimizing the amount of
   infiltrated material, the etch selectivity should be further improved.
   Here, an investigation of semi-static sequential infiltration synthesis
   of trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and water into maltoheptaose (MH) films, and
   into hydroxyl-terminated poly(styrene) (PS-OH) films, was performed, by
   varying the process parameters temperature, precursor pulse duration,
   and precursor exposure length. It was found that, by decreasing the
   exposure time from 100 to 20 s, the volumetric percentage on included
   pure Al2O3 in MH could be increased from 2 to 40 vol\% at the expense of
   a decreased infiltration depth. Furthermore, the degree of infiltration
   was minimally affected by temperature between 64 and 100 degrees C.
   Shorter precursor pulse durations of 10 ms TMA and 5 ms water, as well
   as longer precursor pulses of 75 ms TMA and 45 ms water, were both shown
   to promote a higher degree, 40 vol\%, of infiltrated alumina in MH. As
   proof of concept, 12 nm pitch pattern transfer into silicon was
   demonstrated using the method and can be concluded to be one of few
   studies showing pattern transfer at such small pitch. These results are
   expected to be of use for further understanding of the mechanisms
   involved in sequential infiltration synthesis of TMA/water into MH, and
   for further optimization of carbohydrate-based etch masks for sub-10 nm
   pattern transfer. Enabling techniques for high aspect ratio pattern
   transfer at the single nanometer scale could be of high interest, e.g.,
   in the high-end transistor industry.},

Abstract = {Chiral symmetry breaking of phonons plays an essential role in emergent

   interlayer exchange interaction in atomically controlled ferromagnetic
   metal (SrRuO3)-nonmagnetic insulator (SrTiO3) heterostructures. Owing to
   the unconventional interlayer exchange interaction, we have observed
   rotation of spins as a function of nonmagnetic insulating spacer
   thickness, resulting in a spin spiral state. The chiral phonon-spin
   coupling is further confirmed by phonon Zeeman effect. The existence of

Title = {Investigation into the mechanism of electrochemical nitrogen reduction
   reaction to ammonia using niobium oxynitride thin-film catalysts},

Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Niobium oxynitride (NbOxNy) thin films with varying combined non-metal
   vs. metal stoichiometries ( x + y ) and N/O stoichiometric ratios (y/x)
   are investigated for their ability to catalyze the nitrogen re-duction
   reaction and ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy and ammonia measurements show stark differences
   both in nitrogen vs. argon media on each surface and on the surfaces in
   the series when the combined stoichiometry of N + O vs. Nb increases.
   Surface stability checks at fixed intervals during the experiments and
   surface characterization after the experiments us -ing X-ray diffraction
   reveal the least changes occurred to the surface with the highest N + O
   stoichiometry. Based on these observations, an ammonia synthesis
   mechanism is proposed. Isotope labeling experiments on the most
   promising surface of the series, however, show no sign of catalytically
   produced ammonia, possibly due to the lack of stability of the surface
   to endure through the ammonia production cycle. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Coexistence of soft and hard magnetic phases in single layer amorphous
   Tb-Co thin films},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {131},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Amorphous, ferrimagnetic Tb-Co thin films prepared with a thin Ta
   underlayer and either a Ta or a Pt overlayer show evidence of both soft
   and hard magnetic phases. At room temperature, the films exhibit
   conventional ferromagnetism, but low temperature magnetometry
   measurements reveal the decoupling of the two magnetic phases with
   decreasing temperature due to increased anisotropy energy of the hard
   layer at lower temperatures. Decreasing the film thickness to 2nm,
   slightly above the superparamagnetic limit found at 1nm, a soft,
   low-density phase was isolated and found to be present in all the films
   as confirmed with x-ray reflectivity and Rutherford backscattering
   spectrometry measurements. For greater thicknesses, the bottom layer
   retains its soft magnetic nature, while the remainder of the film is
   denser and has strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, leading to the
   exchange-spring behavior when the anisotropy becomes large, either at
   low temperatures or via a Pt overlayer that adds a strong interfacial
   anisotropy to the layer. Micromagnetic simulations of a soft/hard
   bilayer model with the experimentally determined anisotropy and
   magnetization parameters into a soft/hard bilayer model reproduced the
   experimental hysteretic behavior very well. These findings demonstrate
   how the magnetic state and the response of a-Tb-Co films to external
   fields can be controlled, providing a high degree of tunability that is
   promising for high-performance nanoscale devices. Published under an

Title = {Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism at an Oxide-Nitride Interface},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {128},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Heterointerfaces have led to the discovery of novel electronic and
   magnetic states because of their strongly entangled electronic degrees
   of freedom. Single-phase chromium compounds always exhibit
   antiferromagnetism following the prediction of the Goodenough-Kanamori
   rules. So far, exchange coupling between chromium ions via heteroanions
   has not been explored and the associated quantum states are unknown.
   Here, we report the successful epitaxial synthesis and characterization
   of chromium oxide (Cr2O3)-chromium nitride (CrN) superlattices.
   Room-temperature ferromagnetic spin ordering is achieved at the
   interfaces between these two antiferromagnets, and the magnitude of the
   effect decays with increasing layer thickness. First-principles
   calculations indicate that robust ferromagnetic spin interaction between
   Cr3+ ions via anion-hybridization across the interface yields the lowest
   total energy. This work opens the door to fundamental understanding of
   the unexpected and exceptional properties of oxide-nitride interfaces
   and provides access to hidden phases at low-dimensional quantum
   heterostructures.},

Title = {Controlling the Metamagnetic Phase Transition in FeRh/MnRh Superlattices
   and Thin-Film Fe50-xMnxRh50 Alloys},
Journal = {ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES},
Abstract = {Equiatomic and chemically ordered FeRh and MnRh compounds feature a
   first-order metamagnetic phase transition between antiferromagnetic and
   ferromagnetic order in the vicinity of room temperature, exhibiting
   interconnected structural, magnetic, and electronic order parameters. We
   show that these two alloys can be combined to form hybrid metamagnets in
   the form of sputter-deposited superlattices and alloys on
   single-crystalline MgO substrates. Despite being structurally different,
   the magnetic behavior of the alloys with substantial Mn content
   resembles that of the FeRh/MnRh superlattices in the ultrathin
   individual layer limit. For FeRh/MnRh superlattices, dissimilar lattice
   distortions of the constituent FeRh and MnRh layers at the
   antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic transition cause double-step transitions
   during cooling, while the magnetization during the heating branch shows
   a smooth, continuous trend. For Fe(50-x)Mn(x)Rh(50 )alloy films, the
   substitution of Mn at the Fe sites introduces an effective tensile
   in-plane strain and magnetic frustration in the highly ordered epitaxial
   films, largely influencing the phase transition temperature T-M (by more
   than 150 K). In addition, Mn acts as a surfactant, enabling the growth
   of continuous thin films at higher temperatures. Thus, the introduction
   of hybrid FeRh-MnRh systems with adjustable parameters provides a
   pathway for the realization of tunable spintronic devices based on
   magnetic phase transitions.},

   buffers compared to heterostructures with TiO 2-terminated STO buffers
   is correlated with La/Sr exchange and the formation of metallic La 1 -

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},

Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {The magnetic state of exchanged biased CoO(20 nm)/Co(dF) bilayers (dF =
   5-20 nm) was studied by means of polarized neutron reflectometry. By
   introducing a Nb(20 nm) spacer layer between the CoO/Co bilayer and the
   Al2O3 substrate, we designed a resonator structure with significantly
   enhanced intensity of the spin-flip (SF) scattering at the position of
   the optical resonances. For the trained sample with thinnest Co layer
   (dF = 5 nm), we detected strong SF scattering at the resonance position
   to the amount of 30\% of the incoming intensity, pointing to a high
   degree of non-collinearity of the magnetization. With increasing dF, the
   intensity of the SF scattering decreases linearly. Furthermore, an
   unconventional asymmetry of up-down and down-up scattering channels at
   the resonance positions was observed, which we ascribe to the
   out-of-plane magnetic stray field generated by chiral Bloch domain
   walls. This field leads to Zeeman splitting of the neutron energies
   depending on the initial neutron spin polarization. The chirality of the
   domain walls is assigned to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
   emerging at the CoO/Co interface. Our observations might prove useful
   for the design of spintronic devices based on the exchange bias effect.},

Abstract = {We demonstrate growth of epitaxial (100)SmN thin films directly on
   (100)Si surfaces. By using physical vapor deposition of Sm metal in an
   N-2 atmosphere we show that careful control of substrate temperature,
   N-2 pressure, and postannealing steps leads to epitaxial SmN without the
   formation of samarium silicide impurity phases. While rare-earth
   silicide formation competes with and is favored over nitride formation
   at high growth temperatures, we find that low-temperature grown SmN seed
   layers are stable against high-temperature annealing, and thus allow for
   subsequent high-temperature growth of SmN with a clear epitaxial
   relationship to the Si substrate. The relatively low lattice mismatch of
   SmN with (100)Si, compared to other commonly available substrates,
   coupled with the low cost and maturity of Si processing technology
   provide a promising route for further studies of the fundamental
   properties of SmN and other isostructural members of the rare-earth
   nitride series. Because SmN is a ferromagnetic semiconductor, which also
   becomes superconducting close to 4 K under sufficient doping,
   integration with Si technology presents new opportunities for

Abstract = {Control of magnetic states by external factors has garnered a mainstream
   status in spintronic research for designing low power consumption and
   fast-response information storage and processing devices. Previously,
   magnetic-cation substitution was the conventional approach to induce
   ferromagnetism in an intrinsic antiferromagnet. Theoretically, anion
   doping is proposed to be another means to change magnetic ground states.
   Here, the authors demonstrate the synthesis of high-quality single-phase
   chromium oxynitride thin films using in-situ nitrogen doping. Unlike
   antiferromagnetic monoanionic chromium oxide and nitride phases,
   chromium oxynitride exhibits a robust ferromagnetic and insulating
   state, as demonstrated by the combination of multiple magnetization
   probes and theoretical calculations. With increasing the nitrogen
   content, the crystal structure of chromium oxynitride transits from
   trigonal (R3 over bar c) to tetragonal (4 mm) phase and its saturation
   magnetization reduces significantly. Furthermore, they achieve a large
   and controllable exchange bias field in the chromia heterostructures by
   synthetic anion engineering. This work reflects the anion engineering in
   functional oxides towards potential applications in giant

Abstract = {While the atomic structure of interfaces in complex oxide
   heterostructures created by epitaxial growth has been investigated
   extensively, few studies have been conducted on how interfaces form and
   restructure at the initial stage of film growth. The dynamic aspects of
   the growth behavior can strongly influence the final interfacial atomic
   structure, which may lead to the emergence of interface-specific
   properties, such as the rise of interfacial superconductivity between
   certain Ruddlesden-Popper oxide materials. Here, the structural
   development of La2CuO4 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a
   LaSrAlO4 substrate is investigated by X-ray diffraction measurements
   with rapid scans over a volume of reciprocal space. This method provides
   far more detailed information on interface formation than traditional
   fixed-point measurements. The results show that the atomic structure of
   the interface becomes fully established after just a single unit cell of
   growth. Interestingly, restructuring continues to occur within the
   topmost half to one unit cell of the film during the deposition process.
   However, diffraction intensity oscillations from both reflection
   high-energy electron and X-ray measurements stabilize only after the
   growth of two unit cells, indicating that the growth front morphology
   continues to evolve until the start of the third unit cell. This
   multimodal investigation provides insights into the atomic processes
   taking place during layered oxide interface formation, including the
   dynamical rearrangement of LaO and CuO2 layers. Such information is not
   only relevant to the engineering and optimization of functional layer
   structures but can also be critical for ultrathin films.},

   Here, we demonstrate that the spin Hall angle could be enhanced

Title = {Selectivity in atomically precise etching: Thermal atomic layer etching
   of a CoFeB alloy and its protection by MgO},
Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The central unit in an integrated memory device is a magnetic tunnel
   junction (MTJ) consisting of two ferromagnetic layers, often using
   complex alloys such as CoFeB, separated by an insulating barrier such as
   MgO. Atomic level precision is required to fabricate miniaturized
   devices, and atomic layer etching (ALE) is one of the most promising
   methods to do this. However, at the nanoscale, it is imperative to
   maintain the concentration of each element in an alloy during etching,
   and it is important to not affect the insulating barrier, i.e. the
   etching process should stop at MgO. Here we use thermal dry etching of
   CoFeB alloy thin films with sequential doses of chlorine and
   2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone, acacH). Patterned samples are modified
   with atomic level precision, and the process is completely selective to
   the removal of CoFeB alloy in ALE regime without changing the alloy
   composition and without etching MgO that is used as a protecting layer.
   The etching process was investigated by comparing the film thickness on
   a patterned surface before and after ALE process using atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). The viable key features of the reaction mechanism were
   proposed by detection of key desorbing fragments during a heating ramp
   via temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Ex-situ X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to characterize the
   surface during ALE process.},

Abstract = {Oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange kinetics underpin the ionic,
   electronic, and catalytic functionalities of complex multivalent oxides.
   Towards understanding and controlling the kinetics of oxygen transport
   in emerging technologies, it is highly desirable to reveal the
   underlying lattice dynamics and ionic activities related to oxygen
   variation. In this study, the evolution of oxygen content is identified
   in real-time during the progress of a topotactic phase transition in
   La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta epitaxial thin films, both at the surface and
   throughout the bulk. Using polarized neutron reflectometry, a
   quantitative depth profile of the oxygen content gradient is achieved,
   which, alongside atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron
   microscopy, uniquely reveals the formation of a novel structural phase
   near the surface. Surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopies further confirm
   a significant change of the electronic structure accompanying the
   transition. The anisotropic features of this novel phase enable a
   distinct oxygen diffusion pathway in contrast to conventional
   observation of oxygen motion at moderate temperatures. The results
   provide insights furthering the design of solid oxygen ion conductors
   within the framework of topotactic phase transitions.},

Abstract = {Reconfiguration of amorphous complex oxides provides a readily
   controllable source of stress that can be leveraged in nanoscale
   assembly to access a broad range of 3D geometries and hybrid materials.
   An amorphous SrTiO3 layer on a Si:B/Si1-xGex:B heterostructure is
   reconfigured at the atomic scale upon heating, exhibiting a change in
   volume of approximate to 2\% and accompanying biaxial stress. The
   Si:B/Si1-xGex:B bilayer is fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy,
   followed by sputter deposition of SrTiO3 at room temperature. The
   processes yield a hybrid oxide/semiconductor nanomembrane. Upon release
   from the substrate, the nanomembrane rolls up and has a curvature
   determined by the stress in the epitaxially grown Si:B/Si1-xGex:B
   heterostructure. Heating to 600 degrees C leads to a decrease of the
   radius of curvature consistent with the development of a large
   compressive biaxial stress during the reconfiguration of SrTiO3. The
   control of stresses via post-deposition processing provides a new route
   to the assembly of complex-oxide-based heterostructures in 3D geometry.
   The reconfiguration of metastable mechanical stressors enables i)
   synthesis of various types of strained superlattice structures that
   cannot be fabricated by direct growth and ii) technologies based on
   strain engineering of complex oxides via highly scalable lithographic
   processes and on large-area semiconductor substrates.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS},

Volume = {895},

Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {The surface chemistry and thickness of the native oxide, hydroxide, and
   modified sub-surface layer of three Ni superalloys (alloy 59, 625, and
   718) were determined by synchrotron X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
   (XPS) and X-ray Reflectivity (XRR). Taking advantage of the synchrotron
   radiation techniques, a procedure for normalizing the photoelectron
   intensity was employed, which allowed for accurate quantitative analysis
   revealing a total oxide thickness for all samples of 12-13 A, a
   hydroxide layer of 2-3 A, and a thickness of the sub-surface alloy layer
   of 20-35 A. The thickness results were compared to structural atomic
   models suggesting that the oxide thickness corresponds to four planes of
   metal cations in the oxide matrix. The XPS data revealed that the native
   oxides were enriched in Cr3+, Mo-(4,Mo-5,Mo-6)+, and Nb5+, while no Ni
   oxide was detected. The hydroxide layer mainly contained Ni2+ and Cr3+
   hydroxide. The sub-surface layer was enriched in Ni and depleted in Cr,
   Fe, Mo, and Nb. The obtained oxide composition can be explained using
   thermodynamics, and it was found that the oxide composition correlates
   with the enthalpy of oxide formation for the metal elements in the
   alloys. Finally, the advantages of synchrotron radiation for composition
   and thickness determination are discussed. (C) 2021 The Authors.

   proximity effect. Polarized neutron reflectivity is used to examine the
   magnetic profile of the trilayers during magnetization reversal. A
   two-step switching occurs, with the switching angle of the soft layer
   strongly dependent on the strength of the coupling. In the strong

   magnetization is perpendicular to the hard layer whereas in the weak

Title = {Emergence of spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic surface state derived from

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {47},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {FeSi is a nonmagnetic narrow-gap insulator, exhibiting peculiar charge
   and spin dynamics beyond a simple band structure picture. Those unusual
   features have been attracting renewed attention from topological
   aspects. Although the surface conduction was demonstrated according to
   size-dependent resistivity in bulk crystals, its topological
   characteristics and consequent electromagnetic responses remain elusive.
   Here, we demonstrate an inherent surface ferromagnetic-metal state of
   FeSi thin films and its strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) properties
   through multiple characterizations of two-dimensional conductance,
   magnetization, and spintronic functionality. Terminated covalent bonding
   orbitals constitute the polar surface state with momentum-dependent spin
   textures due to Rashba-type spin splitting, as corroborated by
   unidirectional magnetoresistance measurements and first-principles
   calculations. As a consequence of the spin-momentum locking,
   nonequilibrium spin accumulation causes magnetization switching. These
   surface properties are closely related to the Zak phase of the bulk band
   topology. Our findings propose another route to explore noble metal-free
   materials for SOC-based spin manipulation.},

Abstract = {Catalyzing capping layers on metal hydrides are employed to enhance the
   hydrogenation kinetics of metal hydride-based systems such as hydrogen
   sensors. Here, we use a novel experimental method to study the
   hydrogenation kinetics of catalyzing capping layers composed of several
   alloys of Pd and Au as well as Pt, Ni, and Ru, all with and without an
   additional PTFE polymer protection layer and under the same set of
   experimental conditions. In particular, we employ a thin Ta film as an
   optical indicator to study the kinetics of the catalytic layers
   deposited on top of it and which allows one to determine the absolute
   hydrogenation rates. Our results demonstrate that doping Pd with Au
   results in significantly faster hydrogenation kinetics, with response
   times up to five times shorter than Pd through enhanced diffusion and a
   reduction in the activation energy. On the other hand, the kinetics of
   non-Pd-based materials turn out to be significantly slower and mainly
   limited by the diffusion through the capping layer itself. Surprisingly,
   the additional PTFE layer was only found to improve the kinetics of
   Pd-based capping materials and has no significant effect on the kinetics
   of Pt, Ni, and Ru. Taken together, the experimental results aid in
   rationally choosing a suitable capping material for the application of
   metal hydrides and other materials in a hydrogen economy. In addition,
   the used method can be applied to simultaneously study the hydrogenation
   kinetics in thin-film materials for a wide set of experimental
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Herein we systematically investigate the influence of hydrogenation time
   and temperature on defects formation, structural changes, and
   co-catalyst free photocatalytic activity for epitaxially grown anatase
   thin films on strontium titanate single crystals. The photocatalytic
   activity trend of the anatase epi layers is similar to that of anatase
   powders and brookite single crystals in reported recent literature, that
   is, the H-2 evolution rate exhibits a typical maximum upon hydrogenation
   under moderate annealing temperatures (500 degrees C). By combining
   surface sensitive X-ray diffraction methods and analytical
   high-resolution electron microscopy techniques we reveal quantitatively
   the oxygen loss from the epi-layer ascribed to the hydrogenation (H-2
   reduction) treatment. We observe specific physicochemical changes
   associated with the introduction of oxygen vacancies: (i) the formation
   of a nanoscale strained crystal surface, (ii) the agglomeration of point
   defects in the bulk of the anatase epi layer, and (iii) a transition
   towards a Ti2O3 like symmetry at the film surface, i.e. an evident
   oxygen deficiency at the epi layer surface in particular prominent for
   the most active sample as a function of the hydrogenation parameters.
   These extensive experimental findings allow us to propose an empirical
   model, which links detrimental and beneficial effects of Ti3+ centers
   and oxygen vacancies in the bulk and at the surface and their abundance
   to an optimum point defect configuration for water splitting via
   ``grey{''} anatase.},

Abstract = {A structural and FMR study is presented for epitaxial thin films of the
   Heusler alloy Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5 (CFAS) grown on Ge(111) and Si(111)
   substrates. All films, as-grown and post-annealed, show B2 ordering;
   full chemical order (L2(1)) is not obtained over the range of anneal
   temperatures used in this study. As-grown films show a lower Gilbert
   damping constant, alpha, when grown on a Si(111) substrate compared to
   Ge(111). Annealing the films to 450 degrees C significantly reduces
   alpha for CFAS on Ge while increasing alpha for CFAS on Si. This is
   related to a substrate dependent competition between improvements in
   lattice structure and increased interfacial intermixing as a function of
   anneal temperature. The optimal annealing temperature to minimize alpha
   is found to differ by similar to 100 K between the two substrates. Above
   an anneal temperature of 500 degrees C, films grown on both substrates
   have increased coercivity, decreased saturation magnetization, and show
   characteristic two-magnon scattering features.},

Title = {Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructures: A Review},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Abstract = {Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future
   of spintronics due to their large spin-orbit coupling and
   dissipationless, counter-propagating conduction channels in the surface
   state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can
   lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect
   that was first experimentally realized in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)(2)Te-3 films.
   Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very
   low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored.
   Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option,
   with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various
   quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial
   effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile
   materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of
   these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the
   heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable
   structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going
   beyond transition-metal-doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples
   of heterostructures are discussed, including rare-earth-doped TIs,
   magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic
   phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on
   novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems
   including 2D materials is given.},

   the experimental and the simulated results demonstrate that different
   responses of the effective PMA constant and the
   interlayer-exchange-coupling strength to ion irradiation determine the
   magnetic-phase transitions. The structure evolution from experiments and
   theoretical simulations suggests that the ion-irradiation-induced damage
   mainly happens at the Pt/Co interface. The damage leads to the different
   decrease rates of the effective PMA constant and the
   interlayerexchange-coupling strength due to their intrinsic direct and
   Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction nature, respectively. A quite
   good thermal stability of samples is obtained with ion fluence <1.5
   x10(14) ions/cm(2). In this paper, we demonstrate that ion irradiation
   is a promising method to tailor magnetic properties of SAFs.
   Additionally, the ion-irradiation-induced well-controlled
   antiferromagnetically coupled domains could show potential applications
   in spintronic devices.},

Abstract = {The relationship between proximity-induced magnetism (PIM) at the heavy
   metal/ferromagnet interface and spin-transport across such interfaces
   has generated significant debate. To investigate the link between the
   two, element specific x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and
   ferromagnetic resonance measurements were made on the same CoFe/Au/Pt
   and NiFe/Au/Pt thin film samples with varying Au thickness, with
   complementary SIMS analysis, which shows evidence of Ni diffusion from
   NiFe into the Pt. An approximately linear relationship is observed
   between the magnitude of Pt PIM and magnitude of damping enhancement in
   both systems. The results demonstrate that electronic hybridization of
   the heavy metal and ferromagnet is required for a full understanding of
   damping enhancement and interfacial spin-transport for spintronic
   devices.},

Abstract = {The anodic corrosion behavior of 50 angstrom thick single-crystalline
   IrO2 (110) films supported on slightly bulk-reduced TiO2 (110) single
   crystals is studied during acidic water splitting by a unique
   combination of operando techniques, namely, synchrotron-based
   high-energy X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and surface X-ray diffraction
   (SXRD) together with highly sensitive inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS). Corrosion-induced structural and morphological
   changes of the IrO2 (110) model electrode can be followed on the atomic
   scale by operando XRR and SXRD that are supplemented with ex situ
   scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), whereas with ICP-MS, the corrosion rate can be quantified down to
   1 pg.cm(-2).s(-1) with a time resolution on the second scale. The
   operando synchrotron-based X-ray scattering techniques are surprisingly
   sensitive to Ir corrosion of about 0.10 monolayer of IrO2 (110) in
   similar to 26 h, i.e., 0.4 pg.cm(-2).s(-1). The present study
   demonstrates that single-crystalline IrO2 (110) films are much more
   stable than hitherto expected. Although the dissolution rate is very
   small, ICP-MS experiments reveal a significantly higher dissolution rate
   than the operando high-energy XRR/SXRD experiments. These differences in
   dissolution rate are suggested to be due to the different modi operandi
   encountered in ICP-MS (dynamic) and operando XRR/ SXRD experiments
   (steady state), a fact that may need to be considered when hydrogen
   production is coupled to intermittent energy sources such as renewables.},

Title = {One Nanometer HfO2-Based Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions on Silicon},
Journal = {ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In ferroelectric materials, spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to a
   switchable electric polarization, which offers significant promise for
   nonvolatile memories. In particular, ferroelectric tunnel junctions
   (FTJs) have emerged as a new resistive switching memory which exploits
   polarization-dependent tunnel current across a thin ferroelectric
   barrier. This work integrates FTJs with complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible Zr-doped HfO2 (Zr:HfO2)
   ferroelectric barriers of just 1 nm thickness, grown by atomic layer
   deposition on silicon. These 1 nm Zr:HfO2 tunnel junctions exhibit large
   polarization-driven electroresistance (>20 000\%), the largest value
   reported for HfO2-based FTJs. In addition, due to just a 1 nm
   ferroelectric barrier, these junctions provide large tunneling current
   (>1 A cm(-2)) at low read voltage, orders of magnitude larger than
   reported thicker HfO2-based FTJs. Therefore, this proof-of-principle
   demonstration provides an approach to simultaneously overcome three
   major drawbacks of prototypical FTJs: a Si-compatible ultrathin
   ferroelectric, large electroresistance, and large read current for
   high-speed operation.},

Abstract = {Complex oxides provide rich physics related to ionic defects. For the

   viability of this approach is supported by lattice expansion in the
   out-of-plane lattice direction and dramatic change in physical
   properties, i.e., a transition from ferromagnetic metallic to
   antiferromagnetic insulating. In particular, a significant increase of
   resistivity up to four orders of magnitude is evidenced at room
   temperature, upon implantation of highly energetic He ions. The result
   offers an attractive means for tuning the emergent physical properties
   of oxide thin films via strong coupling between strain, defects, and

Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Epitaxial SrRu1-xSnxO3 (0 <= x <= 1) thin films were deposited on SrTiO3
   (001) substrates by sequential two-target synthesis using pulsed laser
   deposition to achieve stable phases in this family of quaternary
   perovskites. The SrRu1-xSnxO3 films exhibit a good crystalline quality,
   a sharp interface between film and substrate, and an atomically smooth
   surface. A gradual expansion of the c-axis lattice parameter was
   observed with Sn doping serving as a means to tune chemical pressure and
   magnetism. With an increase in Sn doping, the resistivity of the film
   increased, and the ferromagnetism decreased. These results illustrate
   use of lattice engineering, e.g., tuning of c-axis lattice parameter
   with chemical doping, to control electronic and magnetic properties of
   epitaxial thin films for applications in oxide electronics.(c) 2021

   Superconductivity in Nickelates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {The recent discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate
   films has aroused great interest since it provides a new platform to
   explore the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. However,
   superconductivity only appears in the thin film form and synthesizing
   superconducting nickelate films is extremely challenging, limiting the
   in-depth studies on this compound. Here, we explore the critical
   parameters in the growth of high-quality nickelate films using molecular
   beam epitaxy. We found that stoichiometry is crucial in optimizing the
   crystalline structure and realizing superconductivity in nickelate
   films. In precursor NdNiO3 films, optimal stoichiometry of cations
   yields the most compact lattice while off-stoichiometry of cations
   causes obvious lattice expansion, influencing the subsequent topotactic
   reduction and the emergence of superconductivity in infinite-layer
   nickelates. Surprisingly, in-situ reflection high energy electron
   diffraction indicates that some impurity phases always appear once Sr
   ions are doped into NdNiO3 although the X-ray diffraction data are of
   high quality. While these impurity phases do not seem to suppress the
   superconductivity, their impacts on the electronic and magnetic
   structure deserve further studies. Our work demonstrates and highlights
   the significance of cation stoichiometry in the superconducting
   nickelate family.</p>},

Title = {Carbon and Neon Ion Bombardment Induced Smoothing and Surface Relaxation
   of Titania Nanotubes},
Journal = {NANOMATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Titania nanotube arrays with their enormous surface area are the subject
   of much attention in diverse fields of research. In the present work, we
   show that not only 60 keV and 150 keV ion bombardment of amorphous
   titania nanotube arrays yields defect creation within the tube walls,
   but it also changes the surface morphology: the surface relaxes and
   smoothens in accordance with a curvature-driven surface material's
   transport mechanism, which is mediated by radiation-induced viscous flow
   or radiation-enhanced surface diffusion, while the nanotubes act as
   additional sinks for the particle surface currents. These effects occur
   independently of the ion species: both carbon and neon ion bombardments
   result in comparable surface relaxation responses initiated by an ion
   energy of 60 keV at a fluence of 1 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). Using atomic
   force microscopy and contact angle measurements, we thoroughly study the
   relaxation effects on the surface topography and surface free energy,
   respectively. Moreover, surface relaxation is accompanied by further
   amorphization in surface-near regions and a reduction in the mass
   density, as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray reflectivity.
   Since ion bombardment can be performed on global and local scales, it
   constitutes a versatile tool to achieve well-defined and tunable
   topographies and distinct surface characteristics. Hence, different
   types of nanotube arrays can be modified for various applications.},

Journal = {MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful tool for probing thin films at
   length scales down to nanometers. We investigated the use of a neural
   network to predict a two-layer thin film structure to model a given
   measured reflectivity curve. Application of this neural network to
   predict a thin film structure revealed that it was accurate and could
   provide an excellent starting point for traditional fitting methods.
   Employing prediction-guided fitting has considerable potential for more
   rapidly producing a result compared to the labor-intensive but
   commonly-used approach of trial and error searches prior to refinement.
   A deeper look at the stability of the predictive power of the neural
   network against statistical fluctuations of measured reflectivity
   profiles showed that the predictions are stable. We conclude that the
   approach presented here can provide valuable assistance to users of NR
   and should be further extended for use in studies of more complex
   n-layer thin film systems. This result also opens up the possibility of
   developing adaptive measurement systems in the future.},

Abstract = {We describe a neural network-based tool for the automatic estimation of

Abstract = {Ferromagnetic (FM) interlayer exchange coupling of ion-beam sputtered
   Fe/Ge multilayers was investigated by off-specular polarized neutron
   scattering measurements. We observed a monotonously growing correlation
   of magnetic moments in the out-of-plane direction with decreasing Ge
   thickness. The magnetic properties of the multilayers with and without
   the FM interlayer exchange coupling agree well with the three- and
   two-dimensional random anisotropy model, respectively, assuming an FM
   interlayer exchange coupling comparable to the direct exchange
   interaction within the sample plane. The results of the Fe/Ge
   multilayers were used to invoke FM interlayer exchange coupling in a
   neutron polarizing supermirror in order to extend its bandwidth.
   Typically, the bandwidth is limited due to a Curie temperature close to
   room temperature of the thinnest Fe layers with less than 3 nm. We
   propose a modified layer sequence of the neutron polarizing supermirror,
   where the minimum Fe thickness was set to 3.5 nm, whereas the Ge
   thickness was reduced. A performance test of the neutron polarizing
   supermirror showed that the FM interlayer exchange coupling contributed
   to the presence of the magnetization comparable to the bulk and resulted
   in a marked extension in the bandwidth.},

   to increased surface tension inhibiting La and Sr oxides from sticking
   to nucleated Mn3O4 surfaces during the growth at high temperatures.},

   pollutant in Zr) on the optical properties of nitride films grown with
   radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering are reported. Hf defects are
   introduced into nitride films with a sputtering target made of the
   Hf-polluted ``grade 702{''} Zr alloy. Hf defects are found in all
   analyzed films with concentrations at around approximate to 0.5-1 at \%.

Abstract = {The helium behavior and thermal stability of W/Ta bilayer nanocomposite
   were investigated by neutron reflectometry. The results show the W/Ta
   interface is stable after He+ ion irradiation and annealing. Under He+
   ion irradiation, the helium enriched and denuded sublayers are formed at
   W/Ta interfacial region, due to the migration of helium from the W layer
   towards the Ta layer. That results from the lowest He solution energy
   and electron density of Ta layer, and negative energy barrier from W to
   Ta layer. This mechanism enlightens us that dispersing Ta-nanoparticles
   into tungsten can relieve helium deleterious effect in tungsten.},

Abstract = {In the present work, temperature dependent magnetic, structural and
   electronic properties of FeTa films with increasing Ta concentration are
   investigated. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) studies reveal densification of
   the film with increasing Ta concentration. Thermal annealing also
   results in an increased electron density relative to asdeposited film,
   concurrent with increase in grain size as observed from X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and results of Soft-X-ray absorption spectroscopy
   (SXAS). However, grain growth is inhibited with increasing Ta
   concentration by presence of Ta in grain boundary (GB) region. This also
   results in increase in magnetic coercivity (greater than150 \%) as
   observed from magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). The structural
   properties were further correlated with magnetic properties as observed
   from Polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) and Ferromagnetic resonance
   (FMR). Effective magnetic moment of the samples, as observed from PNR
   decreases with increasing Ta concentration and increases with increasing
   annealing temperature, which is in agreement with FMR results.
   Scattering length density profiles, observed from simultaneous fitting
   of XRR and PNR show presence of an oxide layer at surface, as also
   confirmed from SXAS measurements.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {572},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The structural and magnetic properties of amorphous CoFeTaB thin-films
   were studied as a function of tantalum concentration. The investigations
   of the structural properties of amorphous CoFeTaB thin-films were
   undertaken to confirm layer thickness, interface roughness, and their
   amorphous structure. Temperature dependent magnetic characterizations
   were performed in order to extract Curie temperatures and their
   saturation magnetizations of each structure. Curie temperatures and
   saturation magnetizations of amorphous CoFeTaB thin-films show similar
   behaviour, where both quantities decrease with increasing tantalum
   concentration in thin-film structures. These reductions can be
   attributed to a result of a transfer of electrons from the metalloid
   atoms to the unfilled d holes of the 3d transition metals, and diffusion
   of tantalum atoms towards the ferromagnetic layer during thin-film
   deposition. Investigation of tuning both Curie temperature and
   magnetization by the addition of a non-magnetic transition metal is
   crucial for the development of spintronic applications.},

Abstract = {An approach based on the Fisher information (FI) is developed to
   quantify the maximum information gain and optimal experimental design in
   neutron reflectometry experiments. In these experiments, the FI can be
   calculated analytically and used to provide sub-second predictions of
   parameter uncertainties. This approach can be used to influence
   real-time decisions about measurement angle, measurement time, contrast
   choice and other experimental conditions based on parameters of
   interest. The FI provides a lower bound on parameter estimation
   uncertainties, and these are shown to decrease with the square root of
   the measurement time, providing useful information for the planning and
   scheduling of experimental work. As the FI is computationally
   inexpensive to calculate, it can be computed repeatedly during the
   course of an experiment, saving costly beam time by signalling that
   sufficient data have been obtained or saving experimental data sets by
   signalling that an experiment needs to continue. The approach's
   predictions are validated through the introduction of an experiment
   simulation framework that incorporates instrument-specific incident flux
   profiles, and through the investigation of measuring the structural
   properties of a phospholipid bilayer.},

Abstract = {Due to success of desired doping, ion implantation has been widely used
   for semiconductor processing. In this work, we used nitrogen ion
   implantation to enhance magnetism in CeFe12 epitaxial thin films. To
   optimize nitrogen contents in CeFe12 and minimize the damage caused by
   the high-energy ion beam, we varied the thickness of the capping Mo
   layer. The saturation magnetization increased nearly 25\% by nitrogen
   ion implantation into CeFe12 thin film. This phenomenon is explained by
   density functional theory calculations and confirmed by the magnetic
   resonance technique. The ion implantation and design strategy can be
   used for light-ion implantation into lattices to modulate magnetic,

Journal = {THIN SOLID FILMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {734},

Abstract = {Evolution of interface microstructure with addition of more number of
   layers has been investigated on Cr/Ti multilayer which is important for
   application as a mirror or monochromator in the ``water window{''} soft
   X-ray spectral regime. Two sets of Cr/Ti multilayers at moderate and low
   bi-layer thickness regime have been prepared for this purpose using Ion
   Beam Sputtering technique. In one set, Cr/Ti multilayer with 25, 50, 60
   and 100 numbers of bilayers with moderate bi-layer thickness of 3.8 nm
   have been deposited. In another set, four samples each having low
   bilayer thickness of 2.4 nm with 25, 50, 75 and 100 number of bi-layers
   have been prepared and the multilayers have subsequently been
   characterized with Specular X-ray reflectivity and diffuse X-ray
   scattering measurements at grazing incidence with hard X-rays. It is
   observed that cumulative effect of interface imperfections became more
   pronounced with increasing number of bilayers resulting in continuous
   increase in the interface width in both the thickness regimes; however,
   its evolution is not exactly same for the two sets of samples. Diffuse
   X-ray scattering result reveals that for the first set of samples,
   interface imperfections are dominated by interface roughness with no
   change in the interface diffusion with increase in number of layers,
   while for the second set, both interface roughness as well as interface
   diffusion contribute towards the cumulative accumulation of interface
   imperfections which is also confirmed by cross-sectional Transmission
   Electron Microscopy. Finally, performance of the multilayers in water
   window regime has been checked by soft X-ray reflectivity measurements
   using synchrotron radiation. The above results have direct implication
   in utilisation of these multilayers over a wide bi-layer thickness
   regime required to cover the full `water-window' spectrum.},

Title = {Magnetization dynamics in synthetic ferromagnetic thin films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Synthetic ferromagnets (SFMs) possess the same layer structure found in
   the widely studied synthetic antiferromagnets. This consists of two
   ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by a nonmagnetic (NM) spacer forming
   the structure FM1/NM/FM2, but SFMs describe the case where the
   interlayer exchange coupling promotes the parallel alignment of the
   magnetizations of the FM layers. The frequency and phase of the dynamic
   response of these structures depends sensitively on the interlayer
   exchange coupling as well as on the individual layer magnetizations.
   Through experiments and numerical simulations, we show that the dynamic
   response of the two ferromagnetic layers has an orthogonal dependence on
   the difference in layer magnetization and interlayer coupling allowing
   both parameters to be determined accurately. In addition, we are able to
   obtain the phases of the resonant modes, a hitherto challenging
   measurement, and thus show that the conventional acoustic and optical
   description does not fully capture the intricacies of SFM dynamics.
   These findings are directly applicable to the creation of tailored SFMs
   for spintronic devices such as STT/SOT-MRAM where magnetization and
   interlayer coupling are key parameters.},

Abstract = {This work is devoted to disclosing the effect of epitaxial strain on
   crystallographic, transport, and nonlinear optical properties of a
   bilayer structure consisting of one ferroelectric (FE) (BaTiO3 with a
   thickness of 4 nm) and one ferromagnetic (La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 with the
   thickness of 12 nm) layers. Both tensile (of about similar to 6\% caused
   by the MgO substrate) and compressive (of about similar to 1\% caused by
   the SrTiO3 substrate) strains reduce the bulk metal-to-insulator phase
   transition temperature of the La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 layer from 240 K towards
   195 K and 160 K, respectively. The appearance of the effect of colossal
   electroresistance, linear and nonlinear current-voltage behaviours and
   contribution of FE polarization switching in the BaTiO3 layer to the
   conductivity are associated with the influence of epitaxial strain. The
   predominance of the compressive over the tensile strain leads to the
   hysteresis behaviour of electroresistance, maximum conductivity caused
   by the resonant-tunnelling mechanism, and strong nonlinear optical
   dependence on the applied electric field.},

Title = {Cation and anion topotactic transformations in cobaltite thin films
   leading to Ruddlesden-Popper phases},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Topotactic transformations involve structural changes between related
   crystal structures due to a loss or gain of material while retaining a
   crystallographic relationship. The perovskite oxide La0.7Sr0.3CoO3
   (LSCO) is an ideal system for investigating phase transformations due to
   its high oxygen vacancy conductivity, relatively low oxygen vacancy
   formation energy, and strong coupling of the magnetic and electronic
   properties to the oxygen stoichiometry. While the transition between
   cobaltite perovskite and brownmillerite (BM) phases has been widely
   reported, further reduction beyond the BM phase lacks systematic
   studies. In this paper, we study the evolution of the physical
   properties of LSCO thin films upon exposure to highly reducing
   environments. We observe the rarely reported crystalline
   Ruddlesden-Popper phase, which involves the loss of both oxygen anions
   and cobalt cations upon annealing where the cobalt is found as isolated
   Co ions or Co nanoparticles. First-principles calculations confirm that
   the concurrent loss of oxygen and cobalt ions is thermodynamically
   possible through an intermediary BM phase. The strong correlation of the
   magnetic and electronic properties to the crystal structure highlights
   the potential of utilizing ion migration as a basis for emerging
   applications such as neuromorphic computing.},

Abstract = {The effect of in situ oxygen and vacuum annealings on the low bandwidth
   manganite Gd1-x Ca (x) MnO3 (GCMO) thin film with x = 0.4 was
   investigated. Based on the magnetic measurements, the AFM-FM coupling is
   suppressed by the vacuum annealing treatment via destroying the double
   exchange interaction and increasing the unit cell volume by converting
   the Mn4+ to the Mn3+. Consequently, resistance increases significantly
   compared to pristine film. The results are explained by a model obtained
   from the positron annihilation studies, where the vacuum annealing
   increased the annihilation lifetime in A and B sites due to the
   formation of vacancy complexes V (A,B)-V-O, which was not the case in
   the pristine sample. The positron annihilation analysis indicated that
   most of the open volume defects have been detected in the interface
   region rather than on the subsurface layer and this result is confirmed
   by detailed x-ray reflection analysis. On the other hand, the effect of
   oxygen annealing on the unit cell volume and magnetization was
   insignificant. This is in agreement with positron annihilation results
   which demonstrated that the introduction of oxygen does not change the
   number of cation vacancies significantly. This work demonstrates that
   the modification of oxygen vacancies and vacancy complexes can tune
   magnetic and electronic structure of the epitaxial thin films to provide
   new functionalities in future applications.},

Abstract = {Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films, 5.8 nm in thickness, were deposited on
   Nb:SrTiO3 semiconductor substrates to form a Pt/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Nb:SrTiO3
   metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ). A
   high tunneling electroresistance ratio of 800 was achieved at
   room-temperature. It is observed that in the low resistance state, the
   transport characteristic obeys direct tunneling, while in the high
   resistance state, it is dominated by thermal emission. It implies that
   the Schottky barrier on the surface of the semiconductive electrode is
   modulated by the polarization in the ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 barrier,
   generating the high electroresistance ratio. The FTJ also exhibits
   excellent retention for more than 10 000 s and good switching endurance
   for more than 1500 cycles. The results suggest the potential of this

Abstract = {Multiferroic oxide heterostructures consisting of ferromagnetic and
   ferroelectric components hold the promise for nonvolatile magnetic
   control via ferroelectric polarization, advantageous for the
   low-dissipation spintronics. Modern understanding of the magnetoelectric
   coupling in these systems involves structural, orbital, and magnetic
   reconstructions at interfaces. Previous works have long proposed
   polarization-dependent interfacial magnetic structures; however, direct
   evidence is still missing, which requires advanced characterization
   tools with near-atomic-scale spatial resolutions. Here, extensive
   polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) studies have determined the
   magnetic depth profiles of PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3/La(0.6)7Sr(0.33)MnO(3)
   (PZT/LSMO) bilayers with opposite self-polarizations. When the LSMO is
   2-3 nm thick, the bilayers show two magnetic transitions on cooling.
   However, temperature-dependent magnetization is different below the
   lower-temperature transition for opposite polarizations. PNR finds that
   the LSMO splits into two magnetic sublayers, but the inter-sublayer
   magnetic couplings are of opposite signs for the two polarizations.
   Near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy further shows contrasts in both
   the Mn valences and the Mn-O bond anisotropy between the two
   polarizations. This work completes the puzzle for the magnetoelectric
   coupling model at the PZT/LSMO interface, showing a synergic interplay
   among multiple degrees of freedom toward emergent functionalities at
   complex oxide interfaces.},

Abstract = {LixLaySrzMnO3 thin films of various compositions (x,y,z) have been grown
   using pulsed laser deposition. The compositions of the films have been
   studied as a function of deposition temperature, target-to-substrate
   distance and deposition pressure with respect to different cation ratios
   of the targets by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. When
   growing multi-elemental oxide thin films containing lithium (with its
   large mass difference to other elements), lithium loss is most probably
   inevitable. But the desired thin film composition can be achieved by
   selecting specific growth conditions and different target compositions.
   The experiments also elucidate some of the mechanisms behind the
   incongruent lithium transfer from the targets to thin films.},

Abstract = {A well-established method is highly desirable for growing topological
   insulator thin films with low carrier density on a wafer-level scale.
   Here, we present a simple, scalable method based on magnetron sputtering
   to obtain high-quality Bi2Te3 films with the carrier density down to 4.0
   x 10(13) cm(-2). In contrast to the most-used method of high substrate
   temperature growth, we firstly sputtered Bi2Te3 thin films at room
   temperature and then applied post-annealing. It enables the growth of
   highly-oriented Bi2Te3 thin films with larger grain size and smoother
   interface. The results of electrical transport show that it has a lower
   carrier density as well as a larger coherent length (similar to 228 nm,
   2 K). Our studies pave the way toward large-scale, cost-effective
   production of Bi2Te3 thin films to be integrated with other materials in
   wafer-level scale for electronic and spintronic applications.},

Abstract = {The influence of surface and interface roughness on X-ray and extreme
   ultraviolet (EUV) reflectometry is becoming increasingly important as
   layer thicknesses decrease to a few nanometers in next-generation
   nanodevices and multilayer optics. Here we simulate two different
   approaches for numerically modeling roughness, the Nevot-Croce factor
   and the graded-interface method, in the Parratt formalism of calculating
   the complex reflectance of multilayer systems. The simulations were
   carried out at wavelengths relevant to widely used metrology techniques,
   including 0.154 nm for X-ray reflectometry and 13.5 nm for EUV
   lithography. A large discrepancy is observed between the two approaches
   in several situations: when the roughness is large with respect to the
   wavelength, for interfaces with large changes in refractive index across
   the boundary, as well as around reflectance peaks due to interference
   effects. Caution is thus required when using either approach to model
   roughness in these situations. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under

Abstract = {Sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) into
   poly(styrene)-block-maltoheptaose (PS-b-MH) block copolymer using vapors
   of trimethyl aluminum and water was used to prepare nanostructured
   surface layers. Prior to the infiltration, the PS-b-MH had been
   self-assembled into 12 nm pattern periodicity. Scanning electron
   microscopy indicated that horizontal aluminalike cylinders of 4.9 nm
   diameter were formed after eight infiltration cycles, while vertical
   cylinders were 1.3 nm larger. Using homopolymer hydroxyl-terminated
   poly(styrene) (PS-OH) and MH films, specular neutron reflectometry
   revealed a preferential reaction of precursors in the MH compared to
   PS-OH. The infiltration depth into the maltoheptaose homopolymer film
   was found to be 2.0 nm after the first couple of cycles. It reached 2.5
   nm after eight infiltration cycles, and the alumina incorporation within
   this infiltrated layer corresponded to 23 vol \% Al2O3. The alumina-like
   material, resulting from PS-b-MH infiltration, was used as an etch mask
   to transfer the sub-10 nm pattern into the underlying silicon substrate,
   to an aspect ratio of approximately 2:1. These results demonstrate the
   potential of exploiting SIS into carbohydrate-based polymers for
   nanofabrication and high pattern density applications, such as
   transistor devices.},

Abstract = {A novel neutron and X-ray reflectometry sample environment is presented
   for the study of surface-active molecules at solid-liquid interfaces
   under shear. Neutron reflectometry was successfully used to characterise
   the iron oxide-dodecane interface at a shear rate of 7.0x102s-1 using a
   combination of conventional reflectometry theory coupled with the
   summation of reflected intensities to describe reflectivity from thicker
   films. Additionally, the structure adopted by glycerol monooleate (GMO),
   an Organic Friction Modifier, when adsorbed at the iron oxide-dodecane
   interface at a shear rate of 7.0x102s-1 was studied. It was found that
   GMO forms a surface layer that appears unaltered by the effect of shear,
   where the thickness of the GMO layer was found to be 24.3-10.2+9.9
   angstrom under direct shear at 7.0x102s-1 and 25.8-5.2+4.4 angstrom when

Title = {Electron Trapping and Detrapping in an Oxide Two-Dimensional Electron
   Gas: The Role of Ferroelastic Twin Walls},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The choice of electrostatic gating over the conventional chemical doping
   for phase engineering of quantum materials is attributed to the fact
   that the former can reversibly tune the carrier density without
   affecting the system?s level of disorder. However, this proposition
   seems to break down in field-effect transistors involving SrTiO3
   (STO)-based two-dimensional electron gases. Such peculiar behavior is
   associated with electron trapping under an external electric field.
   However, the microscopic nature of the trapping centers remains an open
   question. In this paper, we investigate electric-field-induced
   chargetrapping and charge-detrapping phenomena at the conducting
   interface between the band insulators ? -Al2O3 and STO. Our transport
   measurements reveal that the charge trapping under a positive back-gate
   voltage (Vg) above the tetragonal-to-cubic structural transition
   temperature (Tc) of STO has a contribution from electric-field-assisted
   thermal escape of electrons from the quantum well, and from clustering
   of oxygen vacancies as well. We observe an additional source of trapping
   below Tc, which arises from the trapping of free carriers at
   ferroelastic twin walls in the STO. Application of a negative Vg results
   in charge detrapping, which vanishes above Tc. This feature demonstrates
   the crucial role of structural domain walls in the electrical transport
   properties of STO-based heterostructures. The number of charges trapped
   (detrapped) at (from) a twin wall is controlled by the net polarity of
   the wall and is completely reversible with a sweep of Vg.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
   exhibits valuable characteristics concerning stability,
   green-processing, flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and ease of
   property modulation, qualifying it as one of the most promising p-type
   organic conductors for thermoelectric (TE) applications. While blending
   with inorganic counterparts is considered a good strategy to further
   improve polymeric TE properties, only a few attempts succeed so far due
   to inhomogeneous embedding and the non-ideal organic-inorganic contact.
   Here a new strategy to include nanoparticles (NPs) without any ligand
   termination inside PEDOT:PSS thin films is proposed. Spark
   discharge-generated tin oxide NPs (SnOx-NPs) are ``gently{''} and
   homogenously deposited through low-energy diffusion mode. Strong
   interaction between naked SnOx-NPs and PSS chains occurs in the topmost
   layer, causing a structural reorganization towards an improved PEDOT
   chains crystalline packing at the bottom, providing a positive
   contribution to the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, dedoping and
   energy filtering effect introduced by the SnOx-NPs cause dramatic
   Seebeck coefficient enhancement. The optimized power factor of 116 mu
   Wm(-1) K-2 achieved is more than six times higher than the value found
   for the film without NPs. This easy and efficient strategy promises well
   for future mass production of flexible TE devices and the mechanism
   revealed may inspire future research on TEs and flexible electronics.},

Abstract = {Ultrathin nanoporous (NP) films are an emerging field for selective and

   applications. We describe selective ion permeation in
   surface-functionalized ultrathin NP SiO2 films (NP SiO2-NH2). The
   ultrathin NP SiO2 films with ca. 8 nm thickness were prepared from
   silsesquioxane-containing blend polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films
   (nanosheets) using the photo-oxidation method. The porous SiO2 surface
   was modified with a pH-responsive amine-containing silane coupling
   agent. Selective ion permeation was demonstrated under acidic pH
   conditions (pH <= 6) using two equally sized redox probes: negative
   (Fe(CN)(6)(3)(-/)(4-)) and positive (Ru(NH3)(6)(2+)(/)(3+)) ions. The
   current density for Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4- )decreased as the pH value increased
   to pH = 6, whereas it increased for Ru(NH3)(6)(2+/3+). Control
   measurements revealed that the probes can penetrate the pores of
   nonfunctionalized SiO2 films irrespective of pH values, indicating that
   both the size and the surface charge response contributed to selective
   ion permeation. Results obtained from this study pave the way for new

Abstract = {Spin-pumping and spin-orbit torque efficiencies in ferromagnetic/heavy

   hard axes of Fe0.79Si0.21 in epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111)
   bilayers, a large difference between spin-orbit torques generated from
   Pt(111) was observed by a harmonic Hall resistance measurement method.
   Both of the results suggest that spin current transmission efficiency is
   related to the anisotropic spin Hall effect of epitaxial Pt(111) layer
   due to the different spin-orbit interaction energies along the different
   crystallographic directions of Pt.},

Title = {Enhancement of ferroelectricity and orientation in solution-derived
   hafnia thin films through heterogeneous grain nucleation},
Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},

Abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate an approach for improving ferroelectric
   properties of La:HfO2 thin films by shifting the grain growth regime
   toward heterogeneous nucleation. A dilute 0.083 M instead of a 0.25 M
   solution together with an annealing step after every spin-coating cycle
   film gives rise to a significant improvement of ferroelectric
   properties. While a remanent polarization of 7 mu C/cm(2) was found for
   randomly oriented conventional films, the value of 15 mu C/cm(2) for the
   dilute solution is a result of a mixed 111 and 002 preferential
   orientation. A more than 50\% improved breakdown voltage stems from a
   global density improvement from 8.0 to 8.4g/cm(3) as obtained from x-ray
   reflectivity (XRR). We also find superstructure peaks in XRR hinting on
   periodic alternations of the local density throughout the film
   thickness. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion
   mass spectrometry confirm this periodicity. The sensitivity of XRR for
   this periodicity was leveraged to gain further insights in the origin of
   this superstructure with additional experiments. We conclude that both
   orientation and the superstructure are caused by a ``layered
   structure{''} according to Schuler's microstructural zone model.
   However, our data also provide evidence for parallel chemical effects of
   cap formation in each stacked sub-layer. While this work shows a
   significant enhancement of ferroelectric properties, it also provides
   insights into further optimization potential of solution deposition of
   HfO2/ZrO2 thin films. Our XRR-based approach supplemented with suitable
   additional analysis can be of great value for the optimization of other
   solution-derived thin films beyond the material class studied here.},

Abstract = {Noncovalent interactions at electrified interfaces are key to improving
   activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we showed that
   on RuO2(110) in alkaline solutions, OER activity is cation-dependent,
   being largest in 0.1 M KOH compared to LiOH and NaOH. Using crystal
   truncation rod analysis, -O is detected on the coordinatively
   unsaturated site at 1.5 V-RHE in 0.1 M KOH, suggesting that the
   rate-determining step is -O + OH- -> -OOH + e(-), which is different
   from that in acid involving the final deprotonation of -OOH. The
   ordering of interfacial water in base was found to decrease with
   increasing potential and independent of cations. Using surface-enhanced
   infrared spectroscopy, the density of isolated water molecules (zero
   H-bonds) was found to increase, and the density of icelike water
   molecules (four H-bonds) decreases from Li+ to K+ at OER potentials. The
   higher activity of more isolated interfacial OH - ions in the case of K+
   and the lesser stabilization of -O intermediates by hydration water of
   K+ compared to Na+ and Li+ can result in higher OER activity for KOH.
   This work provides molecular details of the interface as a function of
   potential and electrolyte and enables the design of more active
   electrochemical interfaces.},

Abstract = {Magnetic molecules deposited on a metallic substrate constitute a method
   to engineer the spin properties of the molecule and has potential
   application in low-power information storage devices. Here, the authors
   investigate a superconductor/molecule/normal metal heterostructure and
   demonstrate spin-ordering and proximity induced superconducting
   properties at the metallo-molecular interface.
   Combining magnetic and superconducting functionalities enables lower
   energy spin transfer and magnetic switching in quantum computing and
   information storage, owing to the dissipationless nature of
   quasi-particle mediated supercurrents. Here, we put forward a system
   where emergent spin-ordering and diffusion of Cooper pairs are achieved
   at a non-intrinsically magnetic nor superconducting metallo-molecular
   interface. Electron transport, magnetometry and low-energy muon spin
   rotation are used to probe time-reversal symmetry breaking in these
   structures. By comparing the Meissner expulsion in a system including a
   Cu/C-60 spin-converter interface to one without, we observe a
   paramagnetic contribution that can be explained due to the conversion of
   spin-singlet Cooper pair states into odd-frequency triplet states. These
   results demonstrate the potential of metallo-molecular interfaces to
   achieve singlet to triplet Cooper pair conversion, a capability not
   present in either metal or molecule separately that could be used in the
   generation and controlled diffusion of spin polarised dissipationless
   currents.},

Title = {Thin film growth of phase-separating phthalocyanine-fullerene blends: A
   combined experimental and computational study},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Blended organic thin films have been studied during the last decades due
   to their applicability in organic solar cells. Although their optical
   and electronic features have been examined intensively, there is still a
   lack of detailed knowledge about their growth processes and resulting
   morphologies, which play a key role in the efficiency of optoelectronic
   devices such as organic solar cells. In this study, pure and blended
   thin films of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and the Buckminster fullerene
   (C-60) were grown by vacuum deposition onto a native silicon oxide
   substrate at two different substrate temperatures, 310 and 400 K. The
   evolution of roughness was followed by in situ real-time x-ray
   reflectivity. Crystal orientation, island densities, and morphology were
   examined after the growth by x-ray diffraction experiments and
   microscopy techniques. The formation of a smooth wetting layer followed
   by rapid roughening was found in pure CuPc thin films, whereas C-60
   shows a fast formation of distinct islands at a very early stage of
   growth. The growth of needlelike CuPc crystals losing their alignment
   with the substrate was identified in co-deposited thin films.
   Furthermore, the data demonstrate that structural features become larger
   and more pronounced and that the island density decreases by a factor of
   four when going from 310 to 400 K. Finally, the key parameters roughness
   and island density were well reproduced on a smaller scale by kinetic
   Monte Carlo simulations of a generic, binary lattice model with simple
   nearest-neighbor interaction energies. A weak molecule-substrate
   interaction caused a fast island formation and weak interaction between
   molecules of different species was able to reproduce the observed phase
   separation. The introduction of different same-species and cross-species
   Ehrlich-Schwoebel barriers for interlayer hopping was necessary to
   reproduce the roughness evolution in the blend and showed the growth of
   CuPc crystals on top of the thin film in agreement with the experiment.},

Title = {Magnetic properties and the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
   interaction in exchange biased Pt/Co/NixOy films},
Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {543},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {We show that a trilayer magnetic structure, consisting of a heavy metal
   (Platinum) as a buffer, an ultrathin ferromagnet (Cobalt) as a
   functional layer, and an antiferromagnetic insulator (Nickel oxide,
   NixOy) as a capping, is a host of intriguing physical phenomena
   desirable for spintronics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed
   changes in the ratio of NixOy phases with different stoichiometry. Due
   to strong spin-orbit coupling, the Pt layer induces perpendicular
   magnetic anisotropy in Co, breaks its structural inversion symmetry, and
   causes an additive effect of Pt/Co and Co/NixOy interfaces to the
   effective interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-eff).
   Manipulation the magnetic anisotropy can be realized by the
   ferromagnetic layer thickness variation and modification of the Co/NixOy
   interface. The NixOy capping layer induces the exchange bias in Co,
   which effective field vertical bar Beb vertical bar can be controlled in
   the range from 0 to 24 mT. The magnitude and direction of B-eb does not
   affect D-eff. The increase of Ar pressure leads to structural
   transformation of the Co/NixOy interface and, consequently, to decrease
   of the surface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-s), the source of
   which is the NiO phase. We demonstrate that the studied Pt/Co/NixOy
   system has a number of functional properties useful for future logic and
   memory applications.},

Abstract = {Current induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in heavy metals with strong
   spin-orbit coupling strength has attracted considerable attention due to
   its potential applications in spintronic technology. Pt, as one of the
   mostly used heavy metals in SOT-based spintronic devices, shows large
   spin Hall angle (hSH) with its single phase and alloy counterparts. In
   this work, the in-plane crystallographic orientations related hSH of
   epitaxial Pt(111) layer is reported in MgO(111)/Pt(111)/Co/Ta
   heterostructures with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The hSH
   shows a quite large difference with values, respectively, around 0.083
   and 0.057 when the current applied along the 1/2 110 similar to and 1/2
   112 similar to crystallographic directions of Pt(111) by the
   damping-like SOT efficiency using the harmonic Hall voltage measurement
   technique. The critical switching current densities also show large
   difference between these two orthogonal crystallographic orientations
   with the trend of that the larger SOT efficiency leads to the smaller
   critical switching current density. It independently confirms the
   generation of different dampinglike SOT efficiency when current along
   1/2 110 similar to and 1/2 112 similar to directions of Pt(111).
   Moreover, a perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/Ta reference
   heterostructures with Pt having polycrystalline phase shows tiny
   variation of damping-like SOT efficiency in in-plane two orthogonal
   directions, which also indirectly indicates the crystallographic
   orientations related hSH in epitaxial Pt(111) layers. This study
   indicates that the hSH of epitaxial Pt is a crystallographic
   orientations related parameter.},

Abstract = {We investigated the behavior of a pH-responsive

   that a Langmuir monolayer is formed with the hydrophobic collapsed PS
   block anchoring the hydrophilic polyelectrolyte at the interface. By
   combining macroscopic surface pressure measurements and specular neutron
   reflectivity, we studied the monolayers as a function of surface density
   sigma and pH of the subphase. At pH = 2, the PDMAEMA is fully charged
   and the system at high s behaves as a polyelectrolyte brush with chains
   protruding in water with a gaussian profile. At pH = 10 where the
   PDMAEMA is neutral, the system exhibits a phase transition between the
   pancake configuration to the brush configuration, with a threshold that
   depends on the PDMAEMA chain length, in agreement with theoretical
   predicted scaling laws.},

Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Magnetometry measurements of Fe/U and Ni/U bilayer systems reveal a
   nonmonotonic dependence of the magnetic anisotropy for U thicknesses in
   the range of 0-8 nm with the Fe/U bilayers showing a more prominent
   effect as compared to Ni/U. The stronger response for Fe/U is ascribed
   to the stronger 3d-5f hybridization of Fe and U. This nonmonotonic
   behavior is thought to arise from quantum well states in the uranium
   overlayers. Estimating an oscillation period from the nonmonotonic data,
   and comparing it to Density Functional Theory calculations, we find that
   wave vector matches to the experimental data can be made to regions of
   high spectral density in (010) and (100) cuts of the electronic
   structure of a-U, consistent with the measured texture in the films.
   Unexpectedly, there are also indications of perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy in a subset of Fe/U samples at relatively large U thickness.},

   a sensing response free of any hysteresis. Unlike other sensing
   materials, Ta1-yPdy features the special property that the sensing range
   can be easily tuned by varying the Pd concentration without a reduction
   of the sensitivity of the sensing material. Combined with a suitable

   to achieve the optimum conditions for the growth of the tetra cobalt
   nitride (Co4N) phase. We found that Co-N films grown using the HiPIMS
   process adopt (111) orientation as compared to the growth taking place
   along the (100) direction in the dcMS process. It was observed that
   HiPIMS grown Co-N films were superior in terms of crystallite size and
   uniform surface morphology. The local structure of films was
   investigated using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements.
   We found that the high energy of adatoms in the HiPIMS technique
   assisted in the more excellent stabilization of fcc-Co and the novel
   Co4N phase relative to the dcMS process. Magnetic properties of Co-N
   thin films were studied using magneto-optical Kerr effect, vibrating
   sample magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectivity. It was found
   that though the saturation magnetization remains almost similar in films
   grown by dcMS or HiPIMS processes, they differ in terms of their
   magnetic anisotropy. Such variation can be understood in terms of
   differences in the growth mechanisms in dcMS and HiPIMS processes
   affecting the resulting Co4N phase's local structure. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {In this study, we address the impact of Ti underlayer thickness (UL:
   0-40 nm) on the structural, magnetic, and microscopic properties of TbFe
   thin films. The structural analysis confirmed the intermixing at
   interfaces of the Ti and TbFe layer with the increment of UL
   thicknesses. Out-of-plane (OOP) coercivity (H-c), and saturation field
   (H-s) gradually increased with an increase in UL thickness. For UL = 10
   nm, the domain contrast and OOP stray field strength were enhanced,
   which may be due to the extent of d-d hybridization dominated over the
   influence of interfacial roughness. While for UL = 20, and 40 nm, the
   extent of interfacial roughness dominated the hybridization effects. In
   the case of UL: 20 nm, H-c increased by nearly 6 times more than the
   bare TbFe system. We observed a state with high OOP Hc combined with
   nearly zero OOP stray fields that are found to coexist in the sample.
   The magnetization reversal studies on a large area reveal domain
   nucleation followed by domain wall motion in all the films. The idea of
   tuning magnetic properties by varying thicknesses of Ti UL may be useful
   in spintronics applications.},

Abstract = {Anion ordering is a promising route to engineer physical properties in
   functional heteroanionic materials. A central challenge in the study of
   anion-ordered compounds lies in developing robust synthetic strategies
   to control anion occupation and in understanding the resultant
   implications for electronic structure. Here, we show that epitaxial
   strain induces preferential occupation of F and O on the anion-sites in
   perovskite oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta F gamma films grown on different
   substrates. Under compressive strain, F tends to occupy the apical-like
   sites, which was revealed by F and O K-edge linearly polarized X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations,
   resulting in an enhanced c-axis expansion. Under tensile strain, F tends
   to occupy the equatorial-like sites, enabling the longer Mn-F bonds to
   lie within the plane. The oxyfluoride films exhibit a significant
   orbital polarization of the 3d electrons, distinct F-site dependence to
   their valence band density of states, and an enhanced resistivity when F
   occupies the apical-like anion-site compared to the equatorial-like
   site. By demonstrating a general strategy for inducing preferential
   anion-site occupancy in oxyfluoride perovskites, this work lays the
   foundation for future materials design and synthesis efforts that
   leverage this greater degree of atomic control to realize new polar or
   quasi-two-dimensional materials.},

Abstract = {The influence of magnetite nanoparticles coated with poly(acrylic acid)

   Polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) films were obtained by the

   transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and grazing
   incidence small-angle scattering. Magnetic properties of the films were
   probed via superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
   magnetometry. It was demonstrated that due to the hydrogen bonding
   between P4VP and PAA, the Fe3O4@PAA NPs segregate selectively inside
   P4VP domains, enhancing the microphase separation process. This in turn,
   together with employing carefully optimized dip-coating parameters,
   results in the formation of hybrid thin films with highly ordered
   nanostructures. The addition of Fe3O4@PAA nanoparticles does not change
   the average interdomain spacing in the film lateral nanostructure.
   Moreover, it was shown that the nanoparticles can easily be removed to

Abstract = {Emergent behaviors occur when simple interactions between a system's
   constituent elements produce properties that the individual elements do
   not exhibit in isolation. This article reports tunable emergent
   behaviors observed in domain wall (DW) populations of arrays of
   interconnected magnetic ring-shaped nanowires under an applied rotating
   magnetic field. DWs interact stochastically at ring junctions to create
   mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These combine to give a
   dynamic, field-dependent equilibrium DW population that is a robust and
   emergent property of the array, despite highly varied local magnetic
   configurations. The magnetic ring arrays' properties (e.g., non-linear
   behavior, ``fading memory{''} to changes in field, fabrication
   repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an interesting
   candidate system for realizing reservoir computing (RC), a form of

Abstract = {Exotic material properties and topological nontrivial surface states
   have been theoretically predicted to emerge in {[}111]-oriented
   perovskite layers. The realization of such {[}111]-oriented perovskite
   superlattices has been found challenging, and even the growth of
   perovskite oxide films along this crystallographic direction has been
   proven as a formidable task, attributed to the highly polar character of
   the perovskite (111) surface. Successful epitaxial growth along this
   direction has so far been limited to thin film deposition techniques
   involving a relatively high kinetic energy, specifically pulsed laser
   deposition and sputtering. Here, we report on the self-regulated growth
   of {[}111]-oriented high-quality SrVO3 by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy.
   The favorable growth kinetics available for the growth of perovskite
   oxides by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy on non-polar surfaces was also
   present for the growth of {[}111]-oriented films, resulting in
   high-quality SrVO3(111) thin films with residual resistivity ratios
   exceeding 20. The ability to grow high-quality perovskite oxides along
   energetically unfavorable crystallographic directions using hybrid
   molecular beam epitaxy opens up opportunities to study the transport

Abstract = {Oxide spin detector materials are highly desired for emergent all-oxide
   spintronics. In this work, Permalloy/SrIrO3/Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)(0.7) Ti0.3O3
   (Py/SIO/PMNPT) heterostructures were prepared by pulsed laser deposition
   of SIO thin films epitaxially on (001)-oriented single crystalline PMNPT
   substrates, followed by sputter deposition of Py films upon SIO through
   a shadow mask. The paramagnetic SIO layer, with a large spin-orbit
   coupling, serves as a detector to check the spin current pumped from the
   adjacent ferromagnetic Py layer through the inverse spin Hall effect
   (ISHE). It is observed that the spin pumping amplitude can be reversibly
   tuned by about 50\% through applying a 10kV/cm electric field on the
   piezoelectric PMNPT substrate. The ISHE voltage shows a butterfly
   hysteresis resembling the strain-field curve of PMNPT, indicating the
   relevance of strain coupling at the SIO/PMNPT interface. In situ x-ray
   diffraction reveals that both in-plane and out-of-plane lattice
   parameters of SIO vary with the field applied on PMNPT. These results
   highlight that SIO is a promising candidate material for spin detection,

Abstract = {Many polymorphic crystal structures of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) have

   triclinic unit cell (space group P (1) over bar). This study proves

   using synchrotron radiation in grazing incidence. The unit-cell

Journal = {MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS},

Abstract = {Nanoscale Ru/C multilayers are essential reflective optics in the hard
   x-ray region of 7-20 keV. To understand the layer growth behavior and
   develop ultrathin Ru/C multilayer mirrors with periods smaller than 3.0
   nm, multilayers with different periods of 6.2-1.5 nm were fabricated and
   studied. It is found that the average interface width started to
   increase obviously when the period became smaller than 2.5 nm while the
   surface roughness of different multilayers remained almost the same. The
   intrinsic stress of the multilayer gradually decreased with decreasing
   period and reached a very low value of -82 MPa at d = 2.3 nm. High
   reflectance of 54\% and 65\% (at E = 8.04 keV) were demonstrated for the
   multilayers with periods of 2.5 nm and 3.0 nm, respectively, whereas
   that for 1.9 nm period was significantly lower. To further analyze the
   layer microstructure, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron
   microscopy were used. The polycrystallized structure of Ru remained
   similar for the multilayers with period less than 2.5 nm, while a
   non-continuous layer growth and severe intermixing between Ru and C were
   observed for the multilayer with period of 1.9 nm. The increased
   intermixing between Ru and C was found to be the main reason for the
   larger interface width and lower reflectance of the multilayers with
   period smaller than 2.5 nm. It also indicated that the layer thickness
   threshold for a Ru/C multilayer growing with good layer quality is
   1.0-1.2 nm.},

   mirrors},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Multilayer X-ray mirrors consist of a coating of a large number of
   alternate layers of high Z and low Z materials with a typical thickness
   of 10-100 angstrom, on a suitable substrate. Such coatings play an
   important role in enhancing the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors by
   allowing reflections at angles much larger than the critical angle of
   X-ray reflection for the given materials. Coating with an equal
   thickness of each bilayer (constant period multilayers) enhances the
   reflectivity at discrete energies, satisfying Bragg condition for the
   given thickness. However, by systematically varying the bilayer
   thickness in the multilayer stack (depth graded multilayers), it is
   possible to design X-ray mirrors having enhanced reflectivity over a
   broad energy range. One of the most important applications of such a
   depth graded multilayer mirror is to realize hard X-ray telescopes for
   astronomical purposes. Design of such multilayer X-ray mirrors and their
   characterization with X-ray reflectivity measurements require
   appropriate software tools that can compute X-ray reflectivity for the
   given set of parameters and geometry. We have initiated the development
   of hard X-ray optics for future Indian X-ray astronomical missions, and
   in this context, we have developed a program, DarpanX, to calculate
   X-ray reflectivity for single and multilayer mirrors. It can be used as
   a stand-alone tool for designing multilayer mirrors with required
   characteristics. But more importantly, it has been implemented as a
   local model for the popular X-ray spectral fitting program, XSPEC, and
   thus can be used for accurate fitting of the experimentally measured
   X-ray reflectivity data. DarpanX is implemented as a Python 3 module,
   and an API is provided to access the underlying algorithms. Here we
   present details of DarpanX implementation and its validation for
   different types of multilayer structures. We also demonstrate the model
   fitting capability of DarpanX for experimental X-ray reflectivity
   measurements of single and multilayer samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The thermal stability of Cu/W nano-multilayers deposited on a Si
   substrate using ion beam deposition was analyzed in situ by GISAXS and
   transmission EDX-a combination of methods permitting the observation of
   diffusion processes within buried layers. Further supporting techniques
   such as XRR, TEM, WAXS, and AFM were employed to develop an extensive
   microstructural understanding of the multilayer before and during
   heating. It was found that the pronounced in-plane compressive residual
   stress and defect population induced by ion beam deposition result in
   low thermal stability driven by thermally activated self-interstitial
   and vacancy diffusion, ultimately leading to complete degradation of the
   layered structure at moderate temperatures. The formation of Cu
   protrusions was observed, and a model was formulated for stress-assisted
   Cu diffusion driven by Coble creep along W grain boundaries, along with
   the interaction with Si substrate, which showed excellent agreement with
   the observed experimental data. The model provided the explanation for
   the experimentally observed strong correlation between thin film
   deposition conditions, microstructural properties, and low thermal
   stability that can be applied to other multilayer systems.},

Abstract = {The nature of an interfacial structure buried within a device assembly
   is often critical to its function. For example, the dye/TiO2 interfacial
   structure that comprises the working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar
   cell (DSC) governs its photovoltaic output. These structures have been
   determined outside of the DSC device, using ex situ characterization
   methods; yet, they really should be probed while held within a DSC since
   they are modulated by the device environment. Dye/TiO2 structures will
   be particularly influenced by a layer of electrolyte ions that lies
   above the dye self-assembly. We show that electrolyte/dye/TiO2
   interfacial structures can be resolved using in situ neutron
   reflectometry with contrast matching. We find that electrolyte
   constituents ingress into the self-assembled monolayer of dye molecules
   that anchor onto TiO2. Some dye/TiO2 anchoring configurations are
   modulated by the formation of electrolyte/dye intermolecular
   interactions. These electrolyte-influencing structural changes will
   affect dye-regeneration and electron-injection DSC operational
   processes. This underpins the importance of this in situ structural
   determination of electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfaces within representative
   DSC device environments.},

Abstract = {The strength of the interlayer exchange coupling in {[}Fe/MgO]N(001)
   superlattices with 2 <= N <= 10 depends on the number of bilayer repeats
   (N). The exchange coupling is antiferromagnetic for all the investigated

   compared to N = 2. The sequence of the magnetic switching in two of the
   samples (N = 4, N = 8) is determined using polarized neutron
   reflectometry. The outermost layers are shown to respond at the lowest
   fields, consistent with having the weakest interlayer exchange coupling.
   The results are consistent with the existence of quantum well states
   defined by the thickness of the Fe and the MgO layers as well as the
   number of repeats (N) in {[}Fe/MgO]N(001)superlattices.},

Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Combustion synthesis is a well-known method for synthesis of transparent
   metal oxide thin films at low temperature (<400 degrees C). However,
   their functional properties are often inferior due to high residual
   porosity originating from a release of large amounts of gaseous products
   during combustion reaction. In this paper, indium tin oxide (ITO)
   transparent conductive oxide thin films are prepared through combustion
   synthesis at 350 degrees C and the porosity issue is explored via
   multilayer deposition. When the thickness of individual layers is
   downscaled from 12 to 3 nm, the density increases from 5.8 to 7.0 g
   cm(-3) and porosity decreases from 20 to 3\%. This causes a strong boost
   of conductivity sigma (f) from 220 to 620 S cm(-1), the latter being one
   of the highest values ever reported for low-temperature processed ITO
   films. The effectiveness of this approach is attributed to a large
   specific surface area of thinner individual layers, which strongly
   enhances gas transport during the combustion process. We also show that
   improved crystallinity and a strong increase in tensile in-plane stress
   strongly contribute to the boost in conductivity.},

Abstract = {Removal of organic species from solid surfaces is a crucial process. The
   use of oppositely charged surfactants provides a potential method for
   enhanced removal. Neutron reflectometry has been used to investigate the
   complex behaviour of a pre-adsorbed and tenacious layer of the cationic
   surfactant didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) on a mica surface,
   during exposure to different organic species in solution. The anionic
   surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was shown to be able to remove
   the cationic layer, but only if anionic micelles were present in
   solution. To facilitate comparison with the behaviour of a non-ionic
   surfactant, the direct adsorption of pentaethylene glycol monododecyl
   ether (C12E5) to mica was also studied; low surface coverage adsorption
   was seen at the critical micelle concentration and above. C12E5 was then
   found not to remove the cationic layer, but did include into the layer
   to some degree. The presence of cationic surfactant on the mica was
   however shown to significantly modify the adsorption behaviour of the
   non-ionic surfactant. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely used in the packaging industry in
   conjunction with passivated silicon dioxide, SiO2, to protect
   semiconducting devices. However, defects on the SiO2 film have been
   shown to affect adhesion between the PDMS and the SiO2 film. In this
   study, x-ray reflectivity and x-ray diffraction are used to confirm
   metrology fidelity. In addition, confocal fluorescence microscopy is
   used to visualize defects quickly and non-invasively. We show that
   imaging surface defects as small as 1 mu m is possible on SiO2 films.
   Single molecule fluorescent tracking is conducted to examine the
   diffusion coefficient of PDMS. The diffusion of the polymer chain into
   the substrate microcavities can be used determine possibilities of
   improving adhesion between the two interfaces. Adhesion is estimated by
   area measurements of residue after peeling PDMS from the SiO2 surface as
   well as changes to surface roughness. To validate our methodology,
   various sized defects on substrates such as filter paper and microporous
   aluminum foil are visualized.},

Journal = {NANOMATERIALS},
Year = {2021},

Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Magnetic Weyl semimetals are newly discovered quantum materials with the
   potential for use in spintronic applications. Of particular interest is
   the cubic Heusler compound Co2MnGa due to its inherent magnetic and
   topological properties. This work presents the structural, magnetic and
   electronic properties of magnetron co-sputtered Co2MnGa thin films, with
   thicknesses ranging from 10 to 80 nm. Polarized neutron reflectometry
   confirmed a uniform magnetization through the films. Hard x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a high degree of spin polarization
   and localized (itinerant) character of the Mn d (Co d) valence electrons
   and accompanying magnetic moments. Further, broadband and field
   orientation-dependent ferromagnetic resonance measurements indicated a
   relation between the thickness-dependent structural and magnetic
   properties. The increase of the tensile strain-induced tetragonal
   distortion in the thinner films was reflected in an increase of the
   cubic anisotropy term and a decrease of the perpendicular uniaxial term.
   The lattice distortion led to a reduction of the Gilbert damping
   parameter and the thickness-dependent film quality affected the
   inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. These experimental findings will
   enrich the understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of
   magnetic Weyl semimetal thin films.},

   Ru/C Multilayer Mirror after High Temperature Treatment},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ru/C multilayer mirrors with a period of 2.5 nm and 150 bilayers were
   studied under high-temperature annealing and long-term storage. A
   general increase in the reflectivity was observed after annealing at
   different temperatures from 300 to 700 degrees C, during which a maximum
   enhancement of around 14\% was obtained at 600 degrees C. The highest
   reflectance measured at 8 keV reached 69\% after 600 degrees C
   annealing. This was accompanied by a 6\% expansion of the layer period,
   which could be mainly attributed to carbon layers. The surface roughness
   was not affected by the annealing, whereas the polycrystallization of Ru
   with crystallographic planes parallel to the layer interfaces was
   enhanced. Combining the transmission-electron microscopy measurements,
   it was found that the interdiffusion at the C-on-Ru interface was
   significantly suppressed. The decreased interdiffusion, enhanced optical
   contrast, and larger multilayer period were the main reasons for the
   increased reflectance. The 600 degrees C annealed Ru/C multilayer
   remained intact after 13 months of storage in air, which also
   demonstrated significant temporal stability.},

Abstract = {Titanium monoxide (TiO), an important member of the rock salt 3d
   transition-metal monoxides, has not been studied in the stoichiometric
   single-crystal form. It has been challenging to prepare stoichiometric
   TiO due to the highly reactive Ti2+. We adapt a closely lattice-matched
   MgO(001) substrate and report the successful growth of
   single-crystalline TiO(001) film using molecular beam epitaxy. This
   enables a first-time study of stoichiometric TiO thin films, showing
   that TiO is metal but in proximity to Mott insulating state. We observe
   a transition to the superconducting phase below 0.5 K close to that of
   Ti metal. Density functional theory (DFT) and a DFT-based tight-binding
   model demonstrate the extreme importance of direct Ti-Ti bonding in TiO,
   suggesting that similar superconductivity exists in TiO and Ti metal.
   Our work introduces the new concept that TiO behaves more similar to its
   metal counterpart, distinguishing it from other 3d transition-metal

Abstract = {The influence of a carbon barrier layer to improve the reflectivity of
   Cr/Ti multilayers, intended to be used in the water window wavelength
   regime, is investigated. Specular grazing-incidence X-ray reflectivity
   results of Cr/Ti multilayers with 10 bilayers show that interface widths
   are reduced to similar to 0.24 nm upon introduction of a similar to 0.3
   nm C barrier layer at each Cr-on-Ti interface. As the number of bilayers
   increases to 75, a multilayer with C barrier layers maintains almost the
   same interface widths with no cumulative increase in interface
   imperfections. Using such interface-engineered Cr/C/Ti multilayers, a
   remarkably high soft X-ray reflectivity of similar to 31.6\% is achieved
   at a wavelength of 2.77 nm and at a grazing angle of incidence of 16.2
   degrees, which is the highest reflectivity reported so far in the
   literature in this wavelength regime. Further investigation of the
   multilayers by diffused grazing-incidence X-ray reflectivity and
   grazing-incidence extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements
   using synchrotron radiation suggests that the improvement in interface
   microstructure can be attributed to significant suppression of
   inter-diffusion at Cr/Ti interfaces by the introduction of C barrier
   layers and also due to the smoothing effect of the C layer promoting
   two-dimensional growth of the multilayer.},

Title = {Vacuum ultraviolet enhanced atomic layer etching of ruthenium films},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) enhanced atomic layer etching (ALE) of thin
   (similar to 8nm) Ru films is demonstrated. Oxidation half-cycles of
   2-5min VUV/O-2 co-exposure are used to oxidize near-surface Ru to RuO2
   at 1Torr O-2 and 100-150 degrees C. In situ x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy measurements indicate that RuO2 formation saturates after
   similar to 5min of VUV/O-2 exposure at 100 and 150 degrees C. The depth
   of Ru oxidation is limited by the rate of oxidation and can be
   controlled with substrate temperature and exposure time. Etching
   half-cycles are performed by exposing the oxidized Ru film to HCOOH
   vapor at 0.50Torr for 30s isothermally, which results in the removal of
   the oxidized Ru layer. The amount of Ru removed per ALE cycle is
   determined by comparing ex situ x-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements of
   the film before and after etching. When using 2min VUV/O-2 co-exposure,
   approximately 0.8 and 0.9 angstrom of Ru is etched per cycle at 100 and
   150 degrees C, respectively. XRR and atomic force microscopy
   measurements indicate that the as-deposited and sputtered Ru film
   surface becomes smoother as ALE is performed. The etch rate decreases
   with ALE cycles and corresponds to a slowing oxidation rate, which is
   likely associated with the decrease in surface roughness. Density
   functional theory is used to study the adsorption of oxidants in a model
   Ru system, and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations describe O
   diffusion into the Ru substrate by following an O ``probe{''} atom as it
   moves between Ru(002) atomic planes with 0.50 monolayer (ML) O on the
   surface. NEB results reveal an approximate energetic barrier to
   diffusion, E-a, of 5.10eV for O to move through the second and third
   atomic Ru layers when O, which can form an RuOx species, is subsurface.
   This E-a is in excess of the energetic gain of 4.23eV in adsorbing an O
   atom to Ru(002) with 0.50ML O. The difference in E-a and the adsorption
   energy likely contributes to the self-limiting nature of the oxidation
   and explains the observation that VUV/O-2 co-exposure time must be
   increased to allow additional time for O diffusing into the subsurface
   as it overcomes the barrier to subsurface O diffusion. The self-limiting
   oxidation of Ru arising from VUV/O-2 at low temperatures, in turn,
   enables an ALE process for Ru.},

Abstract = {We describe a bottom-up surface functionalization to design hybrid
   molecular coatings that tether biomembranes using wet chemistry. First,
   a monolayer was formed by immersion in a NH2-Ar-SO3H solution, allowing
   aryldiazonium salt radicals to spontaneously bind to it via strong C
   bonding. After formation of the air-stable and dense molecular monolayer
   (-Ar-SO3H), a subsequent activation was used to form highly reactive
   -Ar-SO2Cl groups nearly perpendicular to the monolayer. These can bind
   commercial surfactants, PEGylated oligomers and other inexpensive
   molecules via their -OH, -COOH, or -NH2 chain end-moieties, to build
   hybrid coatings. Metal and oxidized chromium, semi-conductor n-doped
   silicon (111), are the substrates tested for this protocol and the
   aromatic organic monolayers formed at their surface are characterized by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS reveals unambiguously the
   presence of C-Cr and C-Si bonds, ensuring robustness of the coatings.
   Functional sulfur groups (-SO3H) cover up to 6.5 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of
   the silicon interface and 4.7 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of the oxidized
   chromium interface. These surface concentrations are comparable to the
   classic values obtained when the prefunctionalisation is driven by
   electrochemistry on conductors. Tethered lipid membranes formed on these
   coatings were analyzed by neutron reflectivity at the interface of
   functionalized n-doped silicon substrates after immersion in a solution
   of lipid vesicles and subsequent fusion. Results indicate a rather
   compact hybrid coating of Brij anchor-harpoon molecules that maintain a
   single lipid bilayer above the substrate, on top of a hydrated PEO

Abstract = {The effect of water on the electroactive structuring of a tribologically
   relevant ionic liquid (IL) when dispersed in a polar solvent has been
   investigated at a gold electrode interface using neutron reflectivity
   (NR). For all solutions studied, the addition of small amounts of water
   led to clear changes in electroactive structuring of the IL at the
   electrode interface, which was largely determined by the bulk IL
   concentration. At a dilute IL concentration, the presence of water gave
   rise to a swollen interfacial structuring, which exhibited a greater
   degree of electroresponsivity with applied potential compared to an
   equivalent dry solution. Conversely, for a concentrated IL solution, the
   presence of water led to an overall thinning of the interfacial region
   and a crowding-like structuring, within which the composition of the
   inner layer IL layers varied systematically with applied potential.
   Complementary nanotribotronic atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements
   performed for the same IL concentration, in dry and ambient conditions,
   show that the presence of water reduces the lubricity of the IL boundary
   layers. However, consistent with the observed changes in the IL layers
   observed by NR, reversible and systematic control of the friction
   coefficient with applied potential was still achievable. Combined, these
   measurements provide valuable insight into the implications of water on
   the interfacial properties of ILs at electrified interfaces, which
   inevitably will determine their applicability in tribotronic and
   electrochemical contexts.},

Abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin oxides are crucial for modern quantum
   electronic devices. However, the well -controlled growth of 2D oxide
   materials is highly challenging. In this work, ultrathin single-crystal
   SnO epitaxial films were achieved on r-sapphire by pulsed laser
   deposition. The quasi-2D SnO films have thicknesses ranging from 3.4 to
   25.4 nm, allowing observation of quantum confinement effects in the
   optical bandgap. The critical thickness where the films relax in plane
   is around 19 nm. Below 19 nm, the films are strained compressively in
   plane and tensilely along the c-axis. Quantum confinement effects are
   observed by UV-IR spectroscopy for the optical transition at the direct
   bandgap. By fitting Brus equation, the reduced effective mass is deduced
   to be 0.137 +/- 0.016 me. The exciton radius and binding energy are 4.62
   +/- 0.61 nm and 10.8 +/- 1.2 meV, respectively. These parameters are

Abstract = {MgO-based magnetic heterostructures are crucial building blocks in
   state-of-the-art spintronic devices. In this study, we performed thermal
   annealing to control the formation and distribution of FeO across the
   interface of a Fe-MgO system. The exchange bias phenomenon (i.e., a
   horizontal shift of magnetic hysteresis loops) was extended from
   involving only interface spins to involving the full-volume
   magnetization of the Fe film. The extended and reinforced exchange bias
   coupling in the annealed Fe/MgO(0 0 1) films can be attributed to the
   formation of a Fe-FeO matrix-like structure at the Fe/MgO interface
   under an increasing degree of interface roughness and the reduction or
   diffusion of oxygen from the interfacial oxides, as indicated by X-ray
   absorption near edge structures and X-ray reflectivity measurements.
   Moreover, the thermal stability of exchange bias coupling in the
   annealed Fe/MgO(0 0 1) films (maximum value at approximately 600 K) was
   considerably higher than that in conventional thin-film-based Fe/FeO
   structures (approximately 50 K).},

   multilayers after annealing or Ni addition show a small increase in
   coercivity without considerable changes in their anisotropy. The
   phenomenon of inverted hysteresis with negative remanence, with the
   field being applied perpendicular to the film plane, has been recorded.
   It was modeled with two coexisting magnetic moments with in-plane and

Abstract = {We demonstrate the manipulation of magnetic phases in FeRh thin films

   Atomic scale disorder can be controlled via irradiation with light noble
   gas ions, producing depth-varying nanoscale phase configurations of
   distinct antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic regions.
   Here, we perform a spatial characterization of the magnetic phases and
   the local magnetic environment around the Fe atoms, as well as the
   variation of the open-volumes around atomic sites. Thus, a direct
   correspondence between the existence of the three magnetic phases and
   lattice defects is revealed. By careful selection of the irradiating
   fluence, we show that it is possible to produce simple and thermally
   stable magnetic configurations, such as uniform magnetization or a
   bilayer phase structure. Furthermore, the thin film surface and
   interfaces are observed as the nucleation sites for the transitions
   between the phases. These results demonstrate a sensitive nanoscale
   manipulation of magnetic properties, shedding light on magnetic ordering
   in alloy lattices and broadening the scope for applications.},

Title = {Topotactic phase transformations by concerted dual-ion migration of
   B-site cation and oxygen in multivalent cobaltite La-Sr-Co-O-x films},
Journal = {NANO ENERGY},

Abstract = {Manipulating topotactic phase transformations via orderly ion transfer
   in complex oxides ABO(x) is ubiquitous in advanced applications such as
   ionotronics, ion-batteries and catalysts. Most of such ion-mediated
   transformations are accomplished by the transfer of oxygen or A-site
   ions. However, implementing the transformation via the transfer of
   B-site ions, despite the great challenge to overcome a large cohesive
   energy, has unique advantage since they host most functional properties
   of materials. Here, we present a tri-state phase transformation from
   perovskite (P) to brownmillerite (BM) and to single-layered perovskite
   (SL) structure via the concerted migration of oxygen and B-site Co-ions
   in La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 thin films. Ac-STEM, XPS, XAS, PNR, magnetic and
   electric measurements demonstrated that presented B-site Co-cation
   transfer is along the CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer of the BM film, which
   leads to the reconfiguration of 3d-electrons and spin state in remanent
   Co ions and causes tremendous changes in magnetic and electric
   properties: from canted-antiferromagnetic insulator in BM phase to
   ferromagnetic insulator in SL phase. First-principles calculations
   revealed that the La3+-doping at A-site largely reduces the cohesive
   energy of Co-ions in CoO4 and destabilize the CoO4 tetrahedron of BM
   phase, which explains the formation of Co-ions transfer channel in the
   CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer. The present study highlights the
   effectiveness of regulating topotactic transformation via B-site ions
   transfer and provides a new pathway for manipulating the topotactic
   transformation with diverse functionalities.},

Abstract = {One of the challenges of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is the
   synthesis of oxides containing metals with high electronegativity
   (metals that are hard to oxidize). The use of reactive organometallic
   precursors can potentially address this issue. To investigate the
   formation of radicals in MBE, we explored three carefully chosen
   metal-organic precursors of tin for SnO2 and BaSnO3 growth:
   tetramethyltin (TMT), tetraethyltin (TET), and hexamethylditin (HMDT).
   All three precursors produced single-crystalline, atomically smooth, and
   epitaxial SnO2 (101) films on r-Al2O3
   ( 10
   1 <overbar></mml:mover> 2 <mml:mo stretchy={''}false{''}>) in the
   presence of oxygen plasma. The study of growth kinetics revealed
   reaction-limited and flux-limited regimes except for TET, which also
   exhibited a decrease in the deposition rate with increasing temperature
   above similar to 800 degrees C. Contrary to these similarities, the
   performance of these precursors was dramatically different for BaSnO3
   growth. TMT and TET were ineffective in supplying adequate tin, whereas
   HMDT yielded phase-pure, stoichiometric BaSnO3 films. Significantly,
   HMDT resulted in phase-pure and stoichiometric BaSnO3 films even without
   the use of an oxygen plasma (i.e., with molecular oxygen alone). These
   results are discussed using the ability of HMDT to form tin radicals and
   therefore assisting with Sn -> Sn4+ oxidation reaction. Structural and
   electronic transport properties of films grown using HMDT with and
   without oxygen plasma are compared. This study provides guideline for
   the choice of precursors that will enable the synthesis of metal oxides
   containing hard-to-oxidize metals using reactive radicals in MBE.},

Abstract = {Thin film fabrication of 2D layered organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites
   (2D-OIHPs) for spintronic applications has been attempted using
   solution-based process like Langmuir-Blodgett technique. However,
   monolayer or few-layered 2D magnets are not yet realized, even though a
   wide spectrum of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) OIHPs are known as quasi-2D
   Heisenberg magnets in bulk compounds. Here, chemical exfoliation by
   solvent engineering is applied to successfully synthesize large-sized,
   few unit-cell-thick 2D RP-OIHPs. Comprehensive structural
   characterization reveals that binary co-solvents with high relative
   polarity in spin coating technique are the most effective among nine
   kinds of solvents. Above all, this enables few-layered 2D RP-OIHP
   ultrathin films sustaining their intrinsic magnetic order. It is found
   that XY-like magnetic anisotropy driven by Jahn-Teller effect
   responsible for ferromagnetism in seven-layered (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)CuCl4
   ultrathin films remains very robust, whereas Ising-like dipolar
   anisotropy responsible for canted antiferromagnetism in ten-layered
   (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)MnCl4 ultrathin films is greatly reduced. It is
   expected that ferromagnetism even at monolayer limit should be possible
   by means of further sophisticated solvent engineering as long as
   Jahn-Teller effect is active. The chemical exfoliation using solvent
   engineering unambiguously can bring about a new breakthrough in the
   development of 2D RP-OIHP van der Waals magnets for ultrahigh
   energy-efficient spintronic, opto-spintronic devices.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the potential-induced charge and mass transfer
   between an ultrathin polypyrrole (PPy) film and an electrolyte by
   simultaneous in situ X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and electrochemistry (EC)
   utilizing their sensitivity to electrons. An about 30 nm thin PPy film
   was deposited on a silicon single crystal by fast potential cycling,
   providing a dense film of an extraordinary small surface roughness. XRR
   was recorded from the PPy film in an aqueous 0.1 M perchloric acid at
   electric potentials between -0.2 V and +0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The PPy film
   shows typical reversible and linear changes in film thickness and
   electron density arising from the potential-dependent electrolyte
   incorporation. By introducing EC-XRR, a comprehensive analysis combining
   in situ XRR and EC, the net number of electrons passing through the
   PPy-electrolyte interface was deduced along with the potential-induced
   thickness variations, indicating a complex exchange mechanism.
   Evidently, along with the anion transfer, parallel charge compensation
   by protons and a volume and electron compensating counterflow of solvent
   molecules take place. Complementary time-dependent EC-XRR scans indicate
   that these exchange mechanisms are individual in two potential ranges.
   The low actuation along with a high pseudocapacitance suggest the fast

Abstract = {The multilayer nanostructures have drawn attention in fields from
   spintronics to microwave electronics. The purpose of this work was to
   determine the composition of individual layers and to control interfaces
   in three-layer superstructures {[}(Co40Fe40B20)(34)(SiO2)(66)/ZnO/C](46)
   by means of X-ray diffraction and X-ray reflectivity. The samples with
   different thicknesses of metal-containing composite layers together with
   zinc oxide and carbon interlayers were deposited on the glass substrate
   by ion-beam sputtering of three targets, one of which was a composite
   (Co40Fe40B20)(34)(SiO2)(66). X-ray diffraction results showed the X-ray
   amorphous state of the ferromagnetic metal clusters CoFeB, the
   dielectric matrix of silicon oxide SiO2, and carbon interlayers.
   However, the intermediate layers of the zinc oxide ZnO were found to
   have a nanocrystalline structure. The X-ray reflectivity measurements
   indicate a good agreement between the experimental and nominal values of
   both the periods of three-layer superstructures and the thicknesses of
   metal-containing composite layers and interlayers.},

Abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is used to better understand the
   oxidation of Pd metal using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light co-exposed
   with O-2, which is known to produce O and O-3. The oxidation of Pd metal
   arising from O, O-2, and O-3 is assessed on bare Pd, Pd with a 0.25
   monolayer of adsorbed atomic O, and Pd with increasing O incorporation
   into the substrate. DFT calculations are complemented experimentally by
   co-exposing 20 nm Pd films to 1 Torr of O-2 and VUV photons (6.5 < h nu
   < 11.3 eV) from a D-2 lamp at temperatures ranging from 50 to 200
   degrees C and times from 30 s to 40 min. Oxidation of Pd is
   characterized using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   Co-exposures at 50 degrees C and 1 Torr O-2 are performed with the Pd
   illuminated by the VUV light and shadowed from the VUV light in
   attempting to select for the oxidant that impinges on the Pd surface and
   causes oxidation. Results suggest that atomic O incident from the gas
   phase is responsible for oxidation of Pd, as no PdOx formation is
   observed for the same time period with the sample shadowed. Growth of
   PdOx via O diffusion is studied with the nudged elastic band method.
   Atomic O diffusion through Pd has an activation energy barrier of
   similar to 2.87 eV with respect to a surface O. This decreases to
   similar to 1.80 eV once the 0.25 monolayer of O occupies the surface.
   The extent of Pd oxidation is limited to the near-surface Pd region for
   all times and temperatures investigated. PdOx formation does not appear
   to exceed one to two atomic layers of Pd for conditions explored herein.},

Abstract = {In the field of functional nanomaterials, core-satellite nanoclusters
   have recently elicited great interest due to their unique optoelectronic
   properties. However, core-satellite synthetic routes to date are
   hampered by delicate and multistep reaction conditions and no practical
   method has been reported for the ordering of these structures onto a
   surface monolayer. Herein we show a reproducible and simplified thin
   film process to fabricate bimetallic raspberry nanoclusters using block
   copolymer (BCP) lithography. The fabricated inorganic raspberry
   nanoclusters consisted of a similar to 36 nm alumina core decorated with
   similar to 15 nm Au satellites after infusing multilayer BCP
   nanopatterns. A series of cylindrical BCPs with different molecular
   weights allowed us to dial in specific nanodot periodicities (from 30 to
   80 nm). Highly ordered BCP nanopatterns were then selectively
   infiltrated with alumina and Au species to develop multi-level
   bimetallic raspberry features. Microscopy and X-ray reflectivity
   analysis were used at each fabrication step to gain further mechanistic
   insights and understand the infiltration process. Furthermore,
   grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering studies of infiltrated
   films confirmed the excellent order and vertical orientation over wafer
   scale areas of Al2O3/Au raspberry nanoclusters. We believe our work
   demonstrates a robust strategy towards designing hybrid nanoclusters
   since BCP blocks can be infiltrated with various low cost salt-based
   precursors. The highly controlled nanocluster strategy disclosed here
   could have wide ranging uses, in particular for metasurface and optical
   based sensor applications.},

Abstract = {Water-gated organic field-effect transistors (WGOFETs) are relevant
   devices for use in the fields of biosensors and biosystems. However,
   real applications require very stringent performance in terms of
   electrochemical stability and charge mobility to the organic
   semiconductor in contact with an aqueous environment. Here, a
   comparative study of two small-molecule electron-transporting
   perylenediimide semiconductors, which differ only in the N-substituents
   named PDIF-CN2 and PDI8-CN2 is reported. The two materials present
   similar solid-state arrangements but, while the PDI8-CN2 shows a more 3D
   growth modality and electron mobility independent of the semiconductor
   layer thickness (approximate to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), the PDIF-CN2
   has an almost-2D growth modality and the mobility increases with the
   semiconductor film thickness, reaching a maximum value of approximate to
   5 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 30 nm. Above this thickness, the PDIF-CN2
   switches to a more 3D growth modality, and the mobility drops by one
   order of magnitude. XRR analysis indicates that a PDIF-CN2 film can be
   modeled as a dense layered structure in which each layer is decoupled
   from the others due to the presence of fluorocarbon-chains. The
   availability of additional pathways for charge transport from buried
   layers and the 2D versus 3D growth can explain the mobility dependence
   on the film thickness.},

Abstract = {Down to a cathodic potentials of -1.20 V versus the reversible hydrogen
   electrode, the structure of IrO2(110) electrodes supported by TiO2(110)
   is found to be stable by in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction.
   Such high cathodic potentials should lead to reduction to metallic Ir
   (Pourbaix diagram). From the IrO2 lattice parameters, determined during
   cathodic polarization in a H2SO4 electrolyte solution (pH 0.4), it is
   estimated that the unit cell volume increases by 1\% due likely to
   proton incorporation, which is supported by the lack of significant
   swelling of the IrO2(110) film derived from X-ray reflectivity
   experiments. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that
   protons are incorporated into the IrO2(110) lattice below -1.0 V,
   although Ir remains exclusively in the IV+ oxidation state down to -1.20
   V. Obviously, further hydrogenation of the lattice oxygen of IrO2(110)
   toward water is suppressed for kinetic reasons and hints at a
   rate-determining chemical step that cannot be controlled by the
   electrode potential.},

Title = {Interface evolution of Cr/Ti multilayer films during continuous to
   discontinuous transition of Cr layer},
Journal = {VACUUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cr/Ti multilayers with moderate to low bi-layer thickness have been
   deposited by Ion beam sputtering system and have been investigated
   thoroughly by specular grazing incidence X-ray reflectivity (GIXR) and
   diffused X-ray scattering (both in coplanar and non-coplanar
   configurations) measurements. The investigation is important for
   development of Cr/Ti soft X-ray multilayer mirrors for ``water
   window{''} applications in the wavelength regime of 2.2-4.4 nm.
   Initially few multilayers have been deposited and the highest
   reflectivity at first Bragg peak positions of the GIXR plots have been
   obtained for the Cr layer to bi-layer thickness ratio of 0.4.
   Subsequently, keeping the ratio fixed a set of five samples with
   bi-layer thickness varying from 3.8 nm to 2.1 nm have been prepared. For
   the all five ML samples reported in this communication, Ti layer
   thickness is greater than 1.3 nm, however, the Cr layer thickness varies
   from 1.5 to 0.8 nm in the above range of bi-layer thickness and it
   undergoes continuous-to discontinuous transition. Cr films undergo
   significant change in morphology as the thickness changes and thus the
   interfaces are also evolved differently. Analysis of the diffused X-ray
   scattering data shows that interface imperfection of Ti-on-Cr interfaces
   is dominated by interface diffusion at low Cr thickness (discontinuous)
   regime and by interface roughness at high Cr thickness (continuous)
   regime, while in case of Cr-on-Ti interfaces, interface roughness
   dominates throughout the whole thickness regime. For the sample with
   highest bi-layer thickness of 3.8 nm high Bragg peak reflectivity value
   close to the ideal case is obtained manifesting high thickness
   uniformity, very low interface imperfection and high vertical
   correlation length across the interfaces for this sample which is also
   confirmed by cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy. A 50
   bi-layer sample prepared with the above bi-layer thickness shows high
   reflectivity of 5.6\% at 2.84 nm water window soft X-ray wavelength.},

Abstract = {Amorphous TbxCo100-x magnetic alloys exhibit a list of intriguing
   properties, such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high
   magneto-optical activity, and magnetization switching using ultrashort
   optical pulses. Varying the Tb:Co ratio in these alloys allows for
   tuning properties such as the saturation magnetic moment, coercive
   field, and the performance of light-induced magnetization switching. In
   this paper, we investigate the magnetic, optical, and magneto-optical
   properties of various TbxCo100-x thin-film alloy compositions. We report
   on the effect the choice of different seeding layers has on the
   structural and magnetic properties of TbxCo100-x layers. We also
   demonstrate that for a range of alloys, deposited on fused silica
   substrates, with Tb content of 24-30 at. \%, helicity-dependent
   all-optical switching of magnetization can be achieved, albeit in a
   multishot framework. We explain this property to arise from the
   helicity-dependent laser-induced magnetization on the Co sublattice due
   to the inverse Faraday effect. Our paper provides an insight into
   material aspects for future potential hybrid magnetoplasmonic TbCo-based
   architectures.},

   single-crystalline IrO2(110) film with a regular array of mesoscopic
   rooflike structures that is supported on a RuO2(110)/Ru(0001) template.
   It turns out that the planarity of the single-crystalline IrO2(110) film
   is lost in that IrO2(110) oxide domains delaminate at a cathodic
   potential of -0.18 V. Obviously, the electrolyte solution is able to
   reach the RuO2(110) layer presumably through the surface grain
   boundaries of the IrO2(110) layer. Subsequently, the single-crystalline
   RuO2(110) structure-directing template is reduced to amorphous hydrous
   RuO2, with the consequence that the IrO2(110) film loses partly its
   adhesion to the template. From in situ XRR experiments we find that the
   IrO2(110) film does not swell upon cathodic polarization down to -0.18
   V, while from in situ SXRD experiments, the lattice constants of
   IrO2(110) are shown to be not affected. The rooflike mesostructure of
   the IrO2(110) flakes remains intact after cathodic polarization to -0.18
   V, evidencing that the crystallinity of IrO2(110) is retained.},

Abstract = {We present data for epitaxial thin films of the prototypical

   Observation of this phenomena suggests a complex interplay between
   thermodynamics and kinetics during ESO synthesis; specifically thermal
   history, oxygen chemical potential, and entropy. In addition to the
   compositional degrees of freedom available to ESO systems, subtle
   nuances in atomic structure at constant metallic element proportions can
   strongly influence properties, simultaneously complicating physical

Abstract = {The transition-metal dichalcogenide HfS(2)is a promising alternative
   semiconductor with adequate band gap and high carrier mobility. However,
   a controllable growth of continuous HfS(2)films with selectivity for
   specific surfaces at a low temperature on a large scale has not been
   demonstrated yet. Herein, HfS(2)films are grown at 100 degrees C by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) based on the precursors
   tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium and H2S. In situ vibrational spectroscopy
   allows for the definition of the temperature range over which
   (Me2N)(4)Hf chemisorbs as one monolayer. In that range, sequential
   exposures of the solid surface with (Me2N)(4)Hf and H2S result in
   self-limiting reactions that yield alternating surface termination with
   dimethylamide and thiol. Repeating the cycle grows smooth, continuous,
   stoichiometric films of thicknesses adjustable from angstroms to >100
   nm, as demonstrated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, XRR, AFM, UV-vis and
   Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and TEM. The well-defined surface chemistry
   enables one to deposit HfS(2)selectively using, for example, patterns
   generated in molecular self-assembled monolayers. This novel ALD
   reaction combines several attractive features necessary for integrating
   HfS(2)into devices.},

Abstract = {The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is suppressed by a
   large number of defects in the interface of heterostructure due to
   lattice mismatch. In this paper, the (001) oriented rutile MnO2 thin
   films with different thicknesses were grown on rutile TiO2 substrates.
   The lattice mismatch between film and substrate was minimized through a
   Ti diffusion self-adapting layer. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy
   mappings were used to measure the diffusion range of Ti. The results of
   high-resolution X-ray diffraction confirmed that the dependence of the
   out-of-plane lattice parameter on the thickness was consistent with the
   self-adapting interface model, indicating that Ti diffusion can indeed
   alleviate the lattice mismatch. In addition, the results of the
   synchrotron soft X-ray absorption spectrum indicated that the
   capacitance of the thin films with a large proportion of Ti diffusion
   increased with electrons involved in the reaction. Although the decrease
   of carrier density and conductivity of the thinner films depressed the
   electrochemical activity, it is worth mentioning that the film we
   designed still has considerable specific capacitance even when it is
   very thin, which can provide a new idea for the development of thinner
   and larger capacity potential micro-supercapacitors.},

Title = {Rigid Exchange Coupling in Rare-Earth-Lean Amorphous Hard/Soft
   Nanocomposites},
Journal = {ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Electrification of vehicles and renewable energy is increasing the
   demand for permanent magnets, but the cost and scarcity of rare-earth
   metals is an obstacle. Creating nanocomposites of rigidly
   exchange-coupled hard and soft magnets, for which the magnetization
   reversal occurs as in a single magnetic-phase material, is a promising
   route toward rare-earth-lean permanent magnets with high energy
   products. The hard/soft exchange coupling is, however, often reduced due
   to rough interfaces and structural defects, resulting in exchange-spring
   behavior rather than rigid exchange coupling. Here, it is shown that
   artificially sandwiched hard and soft amorphous magnets produced by
   magnetron sputtering exhibit smooth interfaces, and the first order
   reversal curve (FORC) technique is used to show that the hard and the
   soft phases are rigidly exchange coupled. Micromagnetic simulations,
   using a random-anisotropy model, are used to predict the thickness limit
   of the rigid exchange coupling. A great advantage of amorphous hard/soft
   composites is the possibility to obtain a wide range of magnetic
   properties by finely tuning the composition of the individual phases.},

Abstract = {The La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-d/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta (LSCO/LSMO) bilayer system is
   an ideal perovskite oxide platform for investigating interface
   reconstruction and its effect on their magnetic properties. Previous
   studies have shown that LSCO can separate into magnetic sublayers, which
   possess distinct trends as the total LSCO thickness increases. In this
   study, we used polarized neutron reflectometry to quantify changes in
   the magnetic and chemical depth profiles, and it confirms the formation
   of similar to 12 angstrom-thick interfacial LSCO and LSMO layers,
   characterized by a decreased nuclear scattering length density compared
   to the bulk of the layers. This decrease is attributed to the combined
   effects of oxygen vacancy formation and interfacial charge transfer,
   which lead to magnetically active Co2+ ions with ionic radii larger than
   the Co3+/Co4+ ions typically found in bulk LSCO or single-layer films.
   The interfacial magnetization values, as well as Co2+ ion and oxygen
   vacancy concentrations, depend strongly on the LSCO layer thickness.
   These results highlight the sensitive interplay of the cation valence
   states, oxygen vacancy concentration, and magnetization at interfaces in
   perovskite oxide multilayers, demonstrating the potential to tune their
   functional properties via careful design of their structure.},

   depth profiles at which the low-T-c material is in a ferromagnetic or

Abstract = {Ultrathin Pd/B4C multilayers are suitable X-ray mirrors working at the

   interface roughness-is a little larger than that made by Ar. A stronger
   polycrystallization and a lower content of sputter gas atoms were found
   in the Kr-made sample, which can be explained by the joint effect from
   less recoiled particles and lower sputtering pressure. A good
   reflectance of 68\% of the Kr made multilayer was measured at 10 keV,

Journal = {MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The emergence of thin film CoFeB has driven research and industrial
   applications in the past decades, with the magnetic random access memory
   (MRAM) the most prominent example. Because of its beneficial properties,
   it fulfills multiple functionalities as information-storing,
   spin-filtering, and reference layer in magnetic tunnel junctions. In
   future, this versatility can be exploited beyond the traditional
   applications of spintronics by combining with advanced materials, such
   as oxide-based materials. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is their
   predominant growth-method, and thus the compatibility of CoFeB with this
   growth technique will be tested here. This encompasses a comprehensive
   investigation of the structural and magnetic propoperties. In
   particular, we find a substantial `dead' magnetic layer and confirm that
   it is caused by oxidation employing the x-ray magnetic circular
   dichroism (XMCD) effect. The low damping encountered in vector network
   analyzer-based ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) renders them suitable
   for magnonics applications. These findings demonstrate that CoFeB thin
   films are compatible with emergent, PLD-grown materials, ensuring their
   relevance for future applications.},

   magnetic multilayers},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Artificial ferromagnetic (FM)/nonmagnetic multilayers, with large enough
   FM thickness to prevent the dominance of interface anisotropies, offer a
   straightforward insight into the understanding and control of
   perpendicular standing spin wave (PSSW) modes. Here we present a study
   of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of {[}Co(3.0
   nm)/Au(0.6nm)](1 <= N <= 30) multilayers. Magnetometry reveals that the
   samples exhibit magnetization reversal properties typical of an
   effective single layer with weak perpendicular anisotropy, with the
   distinctive thickness-dependent magnetization reorientation transition
   from uniform in-plane to out-of-plane stripe domains at remanence.
   However, when such multilayer systems are out-of-plane saturated, the
   dynamic response reveals the existence of several different
   ferromagnetic resonances in the form of PSSW modes that strongly depend
   on the material modulation characteristics along the total thickness.
   These modes are induced by the layer stacking itself as the effective
   single layer model fails to describe the observed complex dynamics. In
   contrast to most systems considered in the past, described by a dynamic
   model of a single effectively homogeneous thick layer, the specific
   structures investigated here provide a unique platform for a large
   degree of tunability of the mode frequencies and amplitude profiles. We
   argue that the combination of periodic magnetic properties with vertical
   deformation gradients, arising from heteroepitaxial strain relaxation,
   converts the Au interlayer regions into a vertical regular array of
   magnetic pinning planes for the PSSW modes, which promotes the complex
   dynamics observed in this system.},

Abstract = {Magnetic multilayers offer diverse opportunities for the development of

   elusive. By probing the ferromagnetic resonance modes with

   the magnetization dynamics as a function of depth. Most notably, using
   reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance, we find a phase lag between the
   coupled ferromagnetic layers in {[}CoFeB/MgO/Ta](4) multilayers that is
   invisible to other techniques. The use of reflectometry ferromagnetic
   resonance enables the time-resolved and depth-resolved probing of the

Abstract = {Neutron reflectivity (NR) measurements have been employed to study the
   interfacial structuring and composition of electroresponsive boundary
   layers formed by an ionic liquid (IL) lubricant at an electrified gold
   interface when dispersed in a polar solvent. The results reveal that
   both the composition and extent of the IL boundary layers intricately
   depend on the bulk IL concentration and the applied surface potential.
   At the lowest concentration (5\% w/w), a preferential adsorption of the
   IL cation at the gold electrode is observed, which hinders the ability
   to electro-induce changes in the boundary layers. In contrast, at higher
   IL bulk concentrations (10 and 20\% w/w), the NR results reveal a
   significantly larger concentration of the IL ions at the gold interface
   that exhibit significantly greater electroresponsivity, with clear
   changes in the layer composition and layer thickness observed for
   different potentials. In complementary atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   measurements on an electrified gold surface, such IL boundary layers are
   demonstrated to provide excellent friction reduction and electroactive
   friction (known as tribotronics). In agreement with the NR results
   obtained, clear concentration effects are also observed. Together such
   results provide valuable molecular insight into the electroactive
   structuring of ILs in solvent mixtures, as well as provide mechanistic
   understanding of their tribotronic behaviours.},

Abstract = {Synthesis of crystallographically well-defined thin films of topological
   materials is important for unraveling their mesoscale quantum properties
   and for device applications. Mn3Ge, an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal
   with a chiral magnetic structure on a kagome lattice, is expected to
   have enhanced Berry curvature around Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy,
   leading to large anomalous Hall/Nernst effects and a large spin-Hall
   effect. Using magnetron sputtering, we have grown epitaxial thin films
   of hexagonal D0(19) Mn3Ge that are flat and continuous. Large anomalous
   Nernst and inverse spin-Hall effects are observed in thermoelectric and
   spin-pumping devices. The anomalous Nernst signal in our Mn3Ge films is
   estimated to be 0.1 mu,V/K and is comparable to that in ferromagnetic
   Fe, despite Mn3Ge having a weak magnetization of similar to 3.5 m
   mu(B)/Mn at room temperature. The spin-mixing conductance is 90.5 nm(-2)
   at the Py/Mn3Ge interface, and the spin-Hall angle in Mn3Ge is estimated
   to be about eight times of that in Pt.},

Abstract = {During the 1990s, Roger Cowley had a strong interest in the crystal and
   magnetic structures of rare-earth superlattices as a means to understand
   the rich and exotic magnetic properties of the rare-earth metals.
   High-quality samples can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire
   substrates by first depositing a thin epitaxial layer of niobium, then a
   layer of yttrium or lutetium as a seed. High-resolution x-ray scattering
   is an excellent probe to characterise the crystal quality and was used
   to study the structure of the niobium layer. However, relatively little
   attention was paid to the seed layer. This article summarises some of
   the x-ray experiments performed by the Cowley group to study the
   structure of epitaxial (110) niobium on (11 (2) over bar0) sapphire, and
   extends the work to report some results on the structure of thin (0 00
   1) yttrium seed layers. The structure of the yttrium films is shown to
   have a strong dependence on the thickness of the niobium buffer, with
   the buffer needing to be thicker than a critical value of similar to 80
   degrees A for the formation of misfit dislocations at the Nb/Al2O3
   interface before highly coherent Y films can be grown. Yttrium films
   grown on Nb buffers thinner than similar to 500 degrees A show a similar
   two-peak line shape in q(perpendicular to) scans through their specular
   Bragg peaks to that seen in the specular Nb Bragg peaks, with a
   resolution-limited feature on a broader diffuse peak. The
   resolution-limited feature depends on the thickness of the yttrium film,
   becoming weaker and having a stronger decay with increasing q(parallel
   to) as the film thickness increases, while the width of the yttrium
   broad peak evolves as the square root of the width of the niobium Bragg
   peak. The data are discussed within the context of theories describing
   the scattering from films with misfit dislocations.},

Abstract = {Perpendicularly magnetized layers are essential for information storage
   to increase the storage density. Modulating perpendicular magnetization
   by an electric field offers a promising solution to lower energy
   consumption. Here, we demonstrate a remarkable electric field modulation
   of perpendicular magnetization in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/Ta
   ultrathin films on a ferroelectric substrate. By measuring the anomalous
   Hall effect under in situ electric fields, we observe a giant
   magnetoelectric effect with the large converse magnetoelectric
   coefficient of -2.1 x 10(-6) s m(-1) at H-perpendicular to = -20 Oe and
   -0.9 x 10(-6) s m(-1) at H-perpendicular to = 0 Oe, which is comparable
   to that in multiferroic heterostructures with in-plane magnetization.
   Additionally, Kerr imaging shows that electric fields observably affect
   magnetic domain structures of the Pt/Co/Ta ultrathin films indicating a
   giant magnetoelectric effect. We further measure in situ X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray reflectivity with electric fields, which suggests
   that this giant magnetoelectric effect is attributed to strain-mediated
   magnetoelectric coupling and is closely related to electric-field-varied
   interface roughness. Our findings highlight the role of interface
   roughness in exploring electrical control of perpendicular
   magnetization.},

Abstract = {The proximity-induced moment (PIM) in heavy metal layers may play a
   significant role in heterostructured spintronic systems. In particular,
   the PIM of a heavy metal adjacent to a magnetic layer has been linked to
   interfacial spin transport behavior. Element-resolved x-ray magnetic
   measurements were used to investigate PIM in Pt layered with two
   different rare-earth (RE):3d transition-metal (TM) ferrimagnetic alloys
   in which the net moment was dominated by either the RE or the TM at room
   temperature. We observed significant PIM in Pt confined to a 2-nm
   interfacial region for Pt/Co77Gd23 and Pt/(Fe50Co50)(77)Gd-23 and, in
   both cases, the PIM was parallel to the TM sublattice rather than the RE
   or the net moment. Our results highlight the prominence of the d - d
   mediated interactions between the Pt and the constituents of the
   ferrimagnetic RE:TM alloys over the net macroscopic moment.},

   of BO(6)Octahedra},
Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Control of BO(6)octahedral rotations at the heterointerfaces of
   dissimilar ABO(3)perovskites has emerged as a powerful route for
   engineering novel physical properties. However, its impact length scale
   is constrained at 2-6 unit cells close to the interface and the
   octahedral rotations relax quickly into bulk tilt angles away from
   interface. Here, a long-range (up to 12 unit cells) suppression of
   MnO(6)octahedral rotations in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)through the formation
   of superlattices with SrTiO(3)can be achieved. The suppressed
   MnO(6)octahedral rotations strongly modify the magnetic and electronic
   properties of La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)and hence create a new ferromagnetic
   insulating state with enhanced Curie temperature of 235 K. The emergent
   properties in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)arise from a preferential occupation
   of the out-of-plane Mnd(3)(z)(-)(r)(2)(2)orbital and a reduced Mn
   e(g)bandwidth, induced by the suppressed octahedral rotations. The
   realization of long-range tuning of BO(6)octahedra via superlattices can
   be applicable to other strongly correlated perovskites for exploring new
   emergent quantum phenomena.},

Title = {Magnetic Skyrmions in a Hall Balance with Interfacial Canted
   Magnetizations},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {38},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient
   information-storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been
   experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including
   ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of
   skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful
   pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions.
   However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is
   still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating
   spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate
   to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high-density
   Neel-type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room
   temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall
   balance (core structure {[}Co/Pt](n)/NiO/{[}Co/Pt](n)) with interfacial
   canted magnetizations because of interlayer
   ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom
   {[}Co/Pt](n)multilayers, where the Co layers in {[}Co/Pt](n)are always
   ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the
   generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer
   exchange coupling (IEC) and easy-axis orientation. Direct experimental
   evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided,
   suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative
   mechanism for room-temperature spintronics.},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The cellular membrane is central to the development of single-and
   multicellular life, as it separates the delicate cellular interior from
   the hostile environment. It exerts tight control over entry and exit of
   substances, is responsible for signaling with other cells in
   multicellular organisms and prevents pathogens from entering the cell.
   In the case of bacteria and viruses, the cellular membrane also hosts
   the proteins enabling invasion of the host organism. In a very real
   sense therefore, the cellular membrane is central to all life. The study
   of the cell membrane and membrane proteins in particular has therefore
   attracted significant attention. Due to the enormous variety of tasks
   performed by the membrane, it is a highly complex and challenging
   structure to study. Ideally, membrane components would be studied in
   isolation from this environment, but unlike water soluble proteins, the
   amphiphilic environment provided by the cellular membrane is key to the
   structure and function of the cell membrane. Therefore, model membranes
   have been developed to provide an environment in which a membrane
   protein can be studied. This review presents a set of tools that enable
   the comprehensive characterization of membrane proteins: electrochemical
   tools, surface plasmon resonance, neutron scattering, the surface forces
   apparatus and atomic force microscopy are discussed, with a particular
   focus on experimental technique and data evaluation.},

Title = {Magnetization of Fe4N thin films: Suppression of interfacial intermixing
   using buffer layers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {507},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {We studied the magnetization (M-s) of 60 nm thick polycrystalline Fe4N
   thin films deposited using reactive dc magnetron sputtering. The optimum
   substrate temperature (T-s) to grow an stoichiometric Fe4N phase is
   about 673 K, in agreement with earlier works. However, at this T-s, we
   found that significant intermixing is taking place at the substrate-film
   interface, affecting the M-s of Fe4N film, adversely. We performed
   secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements to extract the
   extent of such intermixing. It was found that Si from the SiO2 substrate
   get interdiffused into Fe4N film forming an undesired interface
   extending up to almost half of the film. As a result, the average M-s of
   Fe4N film get reduced by about 25\% as compared to its theoretical
   value. To prohibit such intermixing, we placed thin layers of Ag, Cu, or
   CrN as a buffer layer between the substrate and Fe4N film. Such buffer
   layer suppress the extent of interdiffusion remarkably. From SIMS
   measurements, we found that among all buffer layers, CrN is most
   suitable as it reduces the extent of intermixing to a minimum level.
   Magnetization measurements performed using bulk magnetization and
   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) methods also clearly revealed that
   the M-s was the highest when CrN buffer layer was used. From these
   results, it becomes apparent that the intermixing taking place at the
   substrate-film interface plays a vital role in affecting the M-s of Fe4N
   thin films. To further suppress such intermixing an attempt was also
   made to bring down the T-s from 673 to 523 K. Obtained results are
   presented and discussed in this work.},

Abstract = {In solid-state chemistry, the direct reaction of elements at low
   temperatures is limited by low solid-state interdiffusion rates. This
   and the limited number of processing parameters often prevent the
   synthesis of metastable compounds. Precisely controlling the number of
   atoms and nanoarchitecture of layered elemental precursors enabled the
   selective synthesis of two closely related metastable tin vanadium
   selenides via near-diffusionless reactions at low temperatures. Although
   the nanoarchitectures of the precursors required to form
   {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) and {[}(SnSe)(1.15)](1) (VSe2)(1) are very
   similar, controlling the local composition of the SnISe layers in the
   precursors enables the selective synthesis of either compound. The
   metastable alloy SnxV1-xSe2 was preferentially formed over
   {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1), which has the identical composition, by
   modifying the nanoarchitecture of the precursor. Ex situ in-plane X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray reflectivity collected as a function of annealing
   temperature provided information on lateral and perpendicular growth of
   {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1). The presence of Laue oscillations
   throughout the self-assembly provided atomic-scale information on the
   thickness of the {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) domains, giving insights
   into the self-assembly process. A reaction mechanism is proposed and

Abstract = {To optimize the catalytic functionality of cerium oxide it is important
   to understand the structural modifications associated with reduction and
   the role of the proximity of metals, which are often coupled with the
   oxide in the applications. For this purpose, the evolution of the short-
   and long-range structure of cerium oxide ultrathin epitaxial films and
   nanostructures supported on Pt(111) is investigated using X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy at the Ce L(3)edge and surface X-ray
   diffraction, during reduction by thermal treatments in vacuum. In
   epitaxial nanoislands reduction is associated with a contraction of the
   Ce-O distance and with the appearance of Ce-Pt bonds. The formation of a
   phase with a (2 x 2) periodicity after a thermal treatment at 1023 K is
   ascribed to the formation of a Pt5Ce alloy. Films of 3 nm thickness do
   not show, on average, significant structural modifications with the same
   thermal treatment, consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction
   involves only the topmost surface layers and it does not influence
   significantly the bulk structure of the material. This study
   demonstrates a strong interaction between cerium oxide and platinum,
   which has implications for the reactivity and stability of catalysts
   based on metals combined with reducible oxides.},

Abstract = {Low-temperature, plasma-free atomic layer etching (ALE) of Pd-0 is
   explored. A vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light source (115 < lambda < 400
   nm) is used in conjunction with a controlled O-2 gas exposure to produce
   PdOx at 100 degrees C. The amount of PdOx that forms is dependent on the
   duration of coexposure of O-2 at 1 Torr and VUV irradiation. A minimum
   coexposure time of 1 min is required to partially oxidize 2 nm Pd while
   3 min is required for 20 nm Pd films, which is verified in situ using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Formic acid vapor is used to
   complete the etch cycle, which does not etch Pd-0 and only removes the
   PdOx that forms. Repeated etch cycles on a similar to 20 nm Pd thin film
   yield an etch rate of 2.81 angstrom/cycle, which is characterized in
   situ using XPS and ex situ using X-ray reflectivity. The morphology of
   the Pd-0 surface does not change appreciably with etching. The only
   observed effect of repeated ALE cycles is a reduction in the roughness
   of the Pd film, which is measured using atomic force microscopy.},

Abstract = {We report the synthesis and characterization of asgrown SrFexMn1-xO2.5
   epitaxial films, which were also subjected to postgrowth oxidation and
   topotactic fluorination to obtain SrFexMn1-xO3 and SrFexMn1-xO2.5-delta

   influence the structural, electronic, and optical properties of this
   family of perovskite materials. The Fe substitution of Mn in SrMnO2.5 is
   gradually expands the c-axis parameter, as indicated by X-ray
   diffraction. With increasing x, the F content incorporated under
   identical fluorination conditions increases, reaching its maximum in
   SrFeO2.5-delta F gamma. In the compounds with mixed B-site occupation,
   the Fe 2p photoemission peaks are shifted upon fluorination, while the
   Mn 2p peaks are not, suggesting inductive effects lead to asymmetric
   responses in how F alters the Mn and Fe bonds. Electronic transport
   measurements reveal all compounds are insulators, with the exception of
   SrFeO3, and demonstrate that fluorination increases resistivity for all
   values of x. Optical absorption spectra in the SrFexMn1-xO2.5 and
   SrFexMn1-xO3 films evolve systematically as a function of x, consistent
   with a physical scenario in which optical changes with Fe substitution
   arise from a linear combination of Mn and Fe 3d bands within the
   electronic structure. In contrast, the F incorporation induces nonlinear
   changes to the optical response, suggesting a more complex impact on the
   electronic structure in materials with concurrent B-site and anion site
   substitution.},

Title = {Magnon diffusion lengths in bulk and thin film Fe3O4 for spin Seebeck
   applications},

Abstract = {The magnon diffusion length (MDL) is understood to play a major role in
   the thickness dependence of spin Seebeck effect (SSE) voltages in
   Fe3O4/Pt thin films. Here we extract the MDL in an Fe3O4 single crystal
   using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and in Fe3O4/Pt thin films
   using accurate heat flux SSE and static magnetization measurements. The
   INS MDLs were 34 +/- 8 nm at 300 K and 27 +/- 6 nm at 50 K. The SSE MDLs
   decreased with temperature (19 +/- 2 nm at 300 K and 13 +/- 4 nm at 50
   K), but were markedly smaller. Whilst the bulk MDL is expected to be an
   upper limit of the MDL in thin films, we show that the film
   magnetization must be considered to obtain MDLs from SSE measurements.
   This study highlights the importance of disentangling the role of
   various effects in SSE measurements which is crucial in increasing the
   efficiencies of thermomagnetic energy harvesting devices.},

Title = {Proximity-Induced Odd-Frequency Superconductivity in a Topological
   Insulator},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {At an interface between a topological insulator (TI) and a conventional
   superconductor (SC), superconductivity has been predicted to change
   dramatically and exhibit novel correlations. In particular, the induced
   superconductivity by an s-wave SC in a TI can develop an order parameter
   with a p-wave component. Here we present experimental evidence for an
   unexpected proximity-induced novel superconducting state in a thin layer
   of the prototypical TI, Bi2Se3 proximity coupled to Nb. From
   depth-resolved magnetic field measurements below the superconducting
   transition temperature of Nb, we observe a local enhancement of the
   magnetic field in Bi2Se3 that exceeds the externally applied field, thus
   supporting the existence of an intrinsic paramagnetic Meissner effect
   arising from an odd-frequency superconducting state. Our experimental
   results are complemented by theoretical calculations supporting the
   appearance of such a component at the interface which extends into the
   TI. This state is topologically distinct from the conventional
   Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state it originates from. To the best of our
   knowledge, these findings present a first observation of bulk
   odd-frequency superconductivity in a TI. We thus reaffirm the potential
   of the TI-SC interface as a versatile platform to produce novel
   superconducting states.},

Abstract = {Expanding the application space of transparent electrodes toward the
   ultraviolet range has been found challenging when utilizing the
   conventional approach to degenerately dope semiconductors with band gaps
   larger than ZnO or In2O3. Here, it is shown that the correlated metal
   SrxNbO3 with x < 1 is ideally suited as a UV-transparent electrode
   material, enabling UV light-emitting diodes for a wide range of
   applications from water disinfection to polymer curing. It is
   demonstrated that SrxNbO3 thin films can be grown by radio frequency
   (RF) sputtering and that they remain in the perovskite phase despite a
   sizeable Sr deficiency. The electrical and optical properties are
   characterized and compared to those of commonly used indium tin oxide
   (ITO) and Sn-doped Ga2O3 transparent conductor standards. SrxNbO3 films
   were found to have sheet resistances as low as 30 Omega sq(-1) with
   optical transmission at a wavelength of 280 nm up to 86\%, marking a
   two-order-of-magnitude increase over the performance of traditional
   UV-transparent conductors. The compatibility of SrxNbO3 with a physical
   vapor deposition technique that is widely employed in the transparent
   conductor coating industry along with the robustness of the highly
   electrically conducting and optically transparent perovskite phase makes
   it an ideal transparent electrode for applications in the UV spectrum.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {The ability to tune the competition between the in-plane and
   out-of-plane orientation of magnetization provides a means to construct
   thermal sensors with a sharp spin reorientation transition at specific
   temperatures. We have observed such a tuneable, temperature-driven spin
   reorientation in structurally amorphous, ferrimagnetic rare-earth
   transition-metal alloy thin films using scanning transmission x-ray
   microscopy and magnetic measurements. The nature of the spin
   reorientation transition in FeGd can be fully explained by a
   nonequilibrium, nanoscale modulation of the chemical composition of the
   films. This modulation leads to a magnetic domain pattern of nanoscale
   speckles superimposed on a background of in-plane domains that form
   Landau configurations in mu m-scale patterned elements. It is this
   speckle magnetic structure that gives rise to a sharp two-step reversal
   mechanism that is temperature dependent. The possibility to balance
   competing anisotropies through the temperature opens opportunities to
   create and manipulate topological spin textures.},

Abstract = {Thin hafnium oxide films were prepared by atomic layer deposition using

   crystal microbalance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

   higher temperatures. The film properties were investigated using x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray reflectivity, x-ray diffraction,
   ellipsometry, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and x-ray
   absorption spectroscopy. The as-deposited films were found to consist of
   an amorphous mixture of HfO2 and B2O3, and had a lower density and lower
   refractive index compared to pure HfO2 thin films. Annealing the films
   to >750 degrees C yielded crystalline monoclinic HfO2 with a density of

Abstract = {Functional thin films are commonly integrated in electronic devices as
   part of a multi-layer architecture. Metal/oxide/metal structurese.g.in
   resistive switching memory and piezoelectric microelectrochemical
   devices are relevant applications. The films are mostly fabricated from
   the vapour phase or by solution deposition. Processing conditions with a
   limited thermal budget typically yield nanocrystalline or amorphous
   layers. For these aperiodic materials, the structure is described in
   terms of the local atomic order on the length scale of a few chemical
   bonds up to several nanometres. Previous structural studies of the
   short-range order in thin films have addressed the simple case of single
   coatings on amorphous substrates. By contrast, this work demonstrates
   how to probe the local structure of two stacked functional layers by
   means of grazing incidence total X-ray scattering and pair distribution
   function (PDF) analysis. The key to separating the contributions of the
   individual thin films is the variation of the incidence angle below the
   critical angle of total external reflection, In this way, structural
   information was obtained for functional oxides on textured
   electrodes,i.e.PbZr(0.53)O(0.47)O(3)on Pt{[}111] and HfO(2)on TiN, as
   well as HfO2-TiO(x)bilayers. For these systems, the transformations from
   disordered phases into periodic structuresviathermal teatment are
   described. These examples highlight the opportunity to develop a
   detailed understanding of structural evolution during the fabrication of
   real thin film devices using the PDF technique.},

Abstract = {Experiments are reported, which allow us to quantify the near-surface

   temperature range, diffusion constants of the order of 10(-20) m(2)/s
   are deduced. These results are important in view of near-surface mass
   transport induced by oxygen chemical potential differences occurring
   when magnetite is exposed to different gas atmospheres or by adsorbates.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {The magnetisation reversal behaviour as a function of composition was
   studied in low rare earth concentration alloys. 30nm thick rare
   earth:transition-metal films of composition GdxCo100-x, GdxFe100-x and
   Gd-x(Co50Fe50)(100-x) were prepared by magnetron sputtering, where x
   ranged from 4 to 13 atomic\%. Magnetisation behaviour was studied using
   MOKE and Hall hysteresis measurements. The magnetic reversal behaviour
   as a function of Gd content is strongly dependent on the transition
   metal. With increasing Gd content the film structure transitions from
   crystalline to amorphous and the saturation magnetisation decreases
   linearly. For GdCo, the reversal field, H-c, increases by less than a
   factor of two with Gd doping of 11\%, while for Fe, the coercivity falls
   by a factor of ten with 8\% Gd. This may be attributed to changes in the
   crystalline morphology. GdCoFe shows a similar trend with Gd doping for
   the in-plane reversal field to that of GdFe. With 13\% Gd in Fe there is
   evidence indicating the presence of a weak perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy, PMA. With Gd doping the anomalous Hall resistivity of Co, Fe
   and CoFe increases significantly with the largest increase observed for
   GdCoFe.},

Abstract = {The Pb(II)-binding mechanism on an annealed hematite (1 (1) over bar 02)
   surface was studied using crystal truncation rod (CTR) X-ray diffraction
   coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The best fit
   CTR model suggested that Pb(II) sorbed selectively to one type of
   edge-sharing surface site (ES2) over two other potential surface sites.
   From the best fit model structure, it was found that the Pb surface
   complex species forms a trigonal pyramid geometry. The base consists of
   three oxygen groups, two of which are associated with the substrate
   surface (O-I and O-III) and one that is a distal O extending toward
   solution. The trigonal pyramid geometry is slightly distorted with Pb-O
   bond lengths ranging from 2.21 to 2.31 angstrom and O-Pb-O bond angles
   ranging from 72 degrees to 75 degrees. Under this structural distortion,
   the nearest distance between Pb and Fe is found to be 3.39(1) angstrom.
   Consistent with the CTR results, DFT calculations indicate the Pb
   binding energy at the ES2 site is at least 0.16 eV more favorable than
   that at the other two potential binding sites considered. Using
   bond-valence rules we propose a stoichiometry of Pb(II) binding on the
   hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface which indicates proton release
   through the deprotonation of all oxygen groups bonding to Pb.},

Abstract = {The vertical component distribution of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active
   film shows a significant impact on determining the device performance in
   polymer solar cells (PSCs). Processing solvent additives are well known
   for regulating the BHJ active layer morphology; however, there are few
   reports regarding the quantitative evaluation of the effect. Herein, a
   study of the quantitative determination of the vertical segregation in
   combination of molecular ordering of PBDB-T/ITIC blend films with
   various 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) contents is provided. A 0.5\% (volume
   ratio) DIO-added blend film achieves the highest power conversion
   efficiency of 10.75\%. The reduced performance of the PSCs resulted from
   the excessive vertical component segregation and overcrystallization
   investigated by various techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   indicates that DIO aggravates the PBDB-T enrichment region at the air
   side. Neutron reflectivity further quantitatively figures out the phase
   separation effect. Although increased crystallinity of ITIC and a higher
   face-on ratio of PBDB-T in active layer were obtained with increased DIO
   content approved by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
   (GIWAXS), the enhanced vertical distribution along with the enhanced
   crystal size of ITIC leads to the reduced performance of the PSCs due to
   the reduced carrier transportation paths between donor and acceptor.},

Abstract = {High energy surface x-ray diffraction (HESXRD), x-ray reflectivity
   (XRR), mass spectrometry (MS) and surface optical reflectance (SOR) have
   been combined to simultaneously obtain sub-second information on the
   surface structure and morphology from a Pd(100) model catalyst during in
   situ oxidation at elevated temperatures and pressures resulting in Pd
   bulk oxide formation. The results show a strong correlation between the
   HESXRD and SOR signal intensities during the experiment, enabling phase
   determination and a time-resolved thickness estimation of the oxide by
   HESXRD, complemented by XRR measurements. The experiments show a
   remarkable sensitivity of the SOR to changes in the surface phase and
   morphology, in particular to the initial stages of oxidation/reduction.
   The data imply that SOR can detect the formation of an ultrathin PdO
   surface oxide layer of only 2-3 angstrom thickness.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {The Hall effect in SrRuO3 thin films near the thickness limit for
   ferromagnetism shows an extra peak in addition to the ordinary and
   anomalous Hall effects. This extra peak has been attributed to a
   topological Hall effect due to two-dimensional skyrmions in the film
   around the coercive field; however, the sign of the anomalous Hall
   effect in SrRuO3 can change as a function of saturation magnetization.
   Here we report Hall peaks in SrRuO3 in which volumetric magnetometry
   measurements and magnetic force microscopy indicate that the peaks
   result from the superposition of two anomalous Hall channels with
   opposite sign. These channels likely form due to thickness variations in
   SrRuO3, creating two spatially separated magnetic regions with different
   saturation magnetizations and coercive fields. The results are central
   to the development of strongly correlated materials for spintronics.},

Abstract = {Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling the
   activity of a given catalyst. This work combines operando
   characterization and computational techniques to examine the oxygen
   evolution reaction mechanism on RuO2 surfaces.
   Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling
   (electro)catalytic activity. Here we employed surface X-ray scattering
   coupled with density functional theory and surface-enhanced infrared
   absorption spectroscopy to examine the oxygen evolution reaction on RuO2
   surfaces as a function of voltage. At 1.5 V-RHE, our results suggest
   that there is an -OO group on the coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium
   (Ru-CUS) site of the (100) surface (and similarly for (110)), but
   adsorbed oxygen on the Ru-CUS site of (101). Density functional theory
   results indicate that the removal of -OO from the Ru-CUS site, which is
   stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a neighbouring -OH (-OO-H), could be
   the rate-determining step for (100) (similarly for (110)), where its
   reduced binding on (100) increased activity. A further reduction in
   binding energy on the Ru-CUS site of (101) resulted in a different
   rate-determining step (-O + H2O - (H+ + e(-)) -> -OO-H) and decreased
   activity. Our study provides molecular details on the active sites, and
   the influence of their local coordination environment on activity.},

Abstract = {Single-crystalline Mg3N2 thin films are grown on MgO (100) substrates
   with plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. To prevent the oxidation of
   the Mg3N2 films and allow further physical characterization, a
   polycrystalline MgO cap is deposited in situ. The growth orientation of
   the Mg3N2 films can be tuned from (100) to (111) by changing the growth
   conditions, and the associated epitaxial relationships have been
   determined by means of x-ray diffraction. The lattice constant of Mg3N2
   films has been monitored as a function of temperature from 300 to 900 K,
   determining thereby the linear thermal expansion coefficient.
   Transmission measurements indicate an optical bandgap of crystalline
   Mg3N2 around 2.9 eV at room temperature, consistent with diffuse
   reflectance measurements on micrometric Mg3N2 particles. These results
   demonstrate the possibility of exploiting Mg3N2 as a new crystalline

Title = {Evidence for Interfacial Octahedral Coupling as a Route to Enhance
   Magnetoresistance in Perovskite Oxide Superlattices},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Engineering octahedral rotations in oxide heterostructures is a
   promising route for controlling magnetic properties in perovskites, with
   recent work focusing on magnetic-ordering temperatures and magnetic
   anisotropies. Here the effects of interfacial octahedral coupling on
   magnetoresistance are demonstrated in a series of
   (La0.7Sr0.3MnO3)(n)/(LaFeO3)(10) superlattices grown on (001)- and
   (111)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. The different crystallographic
   orientations allow for the interfacial octahedral connectivity to be
   tuned, with weaker interfacial coupling present at the (001)-oriented
   than the (111)-oriented structures as revealed by density functional
   theory calculations. In n = 14 superlattices, the effect of orientation
   on the physical properties is minimal with both (001)- and
   (111)-oriented samples exhibiting similar magnetoresistance. As the
   fraction of interfacial volume within the LSMO layers is increased by
   decreasing n, the magnetoresistive behavior of the samples diverges with
   significantly larger magnetoresistance magnitudes present in the
   (111)-oriented superlattices. The results are consistent with octahedral
   coupling playing a greater role in the functional properties at
   (111)-heterointerfaces and demonstrate a structure-driven approach to
   tuning interfacial magnetoresistance in complex-oxide heterostructures.},

Abstract = {Disorders present at the interfaces drive solid state amorphization
   (SSA) and recrystallization in Ni/Ti multilayers. In this communication,
   the effect of disorders present in the bulk Ni layers is studied on SSA
   and recrystallization. The disorder in the Ni layers is created by
   sputtering Ni layers of the Ni/Ti multilayers under the mixed ambience
   of argon and nitrogen. It has been observed recently that the neutron
   optical performances of Ni/Ti graded multilayers or supermirrors can be
   improved by sputtering of Ni layers under the mixed ambience of argon
   and nitrogen. In this work, Ni/Ti periodic multilayers deposited under
   pure argon ambience and under mixed ambience of argon and nitrogen have
   been annealed under vacuum at 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C, and 600
   degrees C for 2 h. All the annealed multilayer samples along with
   as-deposited multilayers are characterized by x-ray diffraction and
   grazing incidence x-ray reflectivity measurements in specular and
   non-specular modes. Atomic diffusion within the layers and across
   interfaces has been studied as a function of annealing temperature for
   both sets of multilayers. It is found that the interstitial nitrogen
   atoms present in the Ni layers play a crucial role in the diffusivity at
   room temperature as well as high temperature and thus influence the SSA
   and recrystallization phenomena.},

Abstract = {Control of the interfacial structures of ionic liquids (ILs) at charged
   interfaces is important to many of their applications, including in
   energy storage solutions, sensors and advanced lubrication technologies
   utilising electric fields. In the case of the latter, there is an
   increasing demand for the study of non-halogenated ILs, as many
   fluorinated anions have been found to produce corrosive and toxic
   halides under tribological conditions. Here, the interfacial structuring
   of a series of four imidazolium ILs ({[}C(n)C(1)Im]) of varying alkyl
   chain lengths (n = 5, 6, 7, 10), with a non-halogenated borate-based
   anion ({[}BOB]), have been studied at charged interfaces using sum
   frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and neutron reflectivity (NR).
   For all alkyl chain lengths, the SFG spectra show that the cation
   imidazolium ring responds to the surface charge by modifying its
   orientation with respect to the surface normal. In addition, the
   combination of SFG spectra with electrochemical NR measurements reveals
   that the longest alkyl chain length (n = 10) forms a bilayer structure
   at all charged interfaces, independent of the ring orientation. These
   results demonstrate the tunability of IL interfacial layers through the
   use of surface charge, as well as effect of the cation alkyl chain
   length, and provide valuable insight into the charge compensation
   mechanisms of ILs.},

Abstract = {Dynamic disorders, which possess a finite charge delocalization, play a
   critical role in the charge transport properties of high-mobility
   molecular organic semiconductors. The use of two-dimensional (2D) charge
   transport in crystalline organic semiconductors can effectively
   facilitate reducing the sensitivity of charge carriers to thermal
   energetic disorders existing in even single crystals to enhance the
   carrier mobility. An isotropic transfer integral among adjacent
   molecules enables a dimensional transition from quasi-one-dimensional to
   2D for charge transport among molecules. Herein, a tuned molecular
   packing, especially molecular rotation, was achieved in highly
   crystalline organic thin films via a brush-coating method. This tuned
   molecular packing was favorable for approaching isotropic transfer
   integrals. Consequently, high-performance organic transistors with a
   carrier mobility up to 21.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and low angle dependence
   were obtained. This work presents a unique modulation of molecular
   packing at the molecular scale to enable less sensitivity of the charge
   transport to dynamic disorders, providing an alternative route for
   enhancing the electrical performance of organic electronic devices.},

Abstract = {The ability to create atomically perfect, epitaxial heterostructures of
   correlated complex perovskite oxides using state-of-art thin film
   deposition techniques has generated new physical phenomena at engineered
   interfaces. Here we report on the impact of growth kinetics on the
   magnetic structure and exchange coupling at the interface in
   heterostructures combining layers of antiferromagnetic La1/3Sr2/3FeO3
   (LSFO) and ferromagnetic La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) on (0 0 1)-oriented
   SrTiO3 (STO) substrates. Two growth orders are investigated, (a)
   LSMO/LSFO/STO(0 0 1) and (b) LSFO/LSMO/STO(0 0 1), where the LSFO layer
   is grown by molecular beam epitaxy and the LSMO layer by high oxygen
   pressure sputtering. The interface has been investigated using electron
   microscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry. Interdiffusion over
   seven monolayers is observed in LSMO/LSFO (a) with an almost 50\%
   reduction in magnetization at the interface and showing no exchange
   coupling. However, the exchange bias effect ( mT at 10 K) could be
   realized when the interface is atomically sharp, as in LSFO/LSMO (b).
   Our study therefore reveals that, even for well ordered and
   lattice-matched structures, the kinetics involved in the growth
   processes drastically influences the interface quality with a strong
   correlation to the magnetic properties.},

Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the in-plane magnetic vector
   configuration in head-to-head/tail-to-tail stripe domain patterns of
   nominal 5 mu m width. The patterns have been created by He-ion
   bombardment induced magnetic patterning of a CoFe/IrMn3 exchange bias
   thin-film system. Quantitative information about the chemical and
   magnetic structure is obtained from polarized neutron reflectometry
   (PNR) and off-specular scattering (OSS). The technique provides
   information on the magnetic vector orientation and magnitude along the
   lateral coordinate of the sample, as well as the chemical and magnetic
   layer structure as a function of depth. Additional sensitivity to
   magnetic features is obtained through a neutron wave field resonance,
   which is fully accounted for in the presented analysis. The scattering
   reveals a domain width imbalance of 5.3 to 3.7 mu m of virgin and
   bombarded stripes, respectively. Further, we report that the
   magnetization in the bombarded stripe significantly deviates from the
   head-to-head arrangement. A domain wall of 0.6 mu m with homogeneous
   magnetization direction is found to separate the two neighboring
   domains. The results contain detailed information on length scales and
   magnetization vectors provided by PNR and OSS in absolute units. We
   illustrate the complementarity of the technique to microscopy techniques
   for obtaining a quantitative description of imprinted magnetic domain
   patterns and illustrate its applicability to different sample systems.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the sheet carrier concentration, n(s), of
   LaCrO3(LCO)/SrTiO3(STO) heterostructures and their structural properties
   has been investigated. Under low oxygen partial pressure, the STO
   substrate is reduced during growth as evidenced by a high n(s) of 10(16)
   cm(-2). By controlling the post-growth annealing conditions,
   heterostructures with n(s) of 10(13)-10(16) cm(-2) are achieved. The
   atomic-scale structure of the samples is obtained using high-resolution
   synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements. For heterostructures with
   n(s) at or below 3 x 10(13) cm(-2), polar distortions are present within
   the LCO layers and increase in magnitude with a decrease in sheet
   carrier concentration. These distortions are absent for samples with
   n(s) on the order of 10(15)-10(16) cm(-2) where interfacial carriers
   play a role in alleviating the polar discontinuity at the LCO/STO
   interface. These results suggest that interfacial charge carriers and
   polar distortions can act as complementary mechanisms to alleviate the
   polar discontinuity at polar/non-polar complex oxide interfaces.},

Abstract = {The atomic and electronic structures of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3
   (LSMO)/La0.7Sr0.3CrO3 (LSCO) multilayer thin films are investigated
   using aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (STEM) imaging and spectroscopy. Atomic resolution high angle annular
   dark-field reveals that LSMO layers have an expanded out-of-plane
   lattice parameter compared to compressed LSCO layers, contrasting with
   x-ray diffraction measurements. The expansion is found to result from
   preferential oxygen vacancy formation in LSMO during STEM sample
   preparation as determined by electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The
   La/Sr atom column intensity is also found to oscillate by about 4\%
   between the LSMO and LSCO layers, indicative of La/Sr concentration
   variation. Using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy in combination
   with image simulations, we confirm the La/Sr inhomogeneity and elucidate
   the origin of charge redistribution within the multilayer. These results
   illuminate the sensitivity of the technique to subtle structural,

Abstract = {The exchange Monte Carlo (MC) method is implemented in a surface
   structure refinement software using Bayesian inference. The MC
   calculation successfully reproduces crystal truncation rod intensity
   profiles from perovskite oxide ultrathin films, which involves about 60
   structure parameters, starting from a simple model structure in which
   the ultrathin film and substrate surface have an atomic arrangement
   identical to the substrate bulk crystal. This shows great tolerance of
   the initial model in the surface structure search. The MC software is
   provided on the web. One of the advantages of using the MC method is the
   precise estimation of uncertainty of the obtained parameters. However,
   the parameter uncertainty is largely underestimated when one assumes
   that the diffraction measurements at each scattering vector are
   independent. The underestimation is caused by the correlation of
   experimental error. A means of estimation of uncertainty based on the
   effective number of observations is demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Thin protein films of gelatin molecules grown on flexible substrates
   have been utilized to fabricate moisture-induced energy-harvesting
   devices, which work as self-biased sensors. Adsorbed water molecules
   from ambient moisture generate protons inside the film. A proton
   transfer path is formed through the hydrogen-bonded water molecules with
   protein around 55\% relative humidity condition, and the protons are
   transferred due to the gradient of absorbed water molecules within the
   protein films. The devices are capable of harvesting electric power up
   to 5.5 mu W/cm(2) with an induced voltage of 0.71 V. Our findings not
   only provide a futuristic clean power generation concept from protein
   film as flexible power generator but also demonstrate the use of the
   energy-harvesting devices as self-biased electronic sensors for various
   flexible and wearable applications. The devices showed exceptional
   performance as humidity sensors and have been used for flexible
   healthcare applications, such as continuous monitoring of breathing
   pattern and lateral mapping of moisture levels at the finger tip for
   monitoring the wound healing process. Nevertheless, the diode-like
   response of the devices with humidity has been found to be suitable as a

Abstract = {In recent years, Hf/ZrO2-based thin films have emerged as promising
   candidates for ferroelectric materials in various applications. However,
   achieving ferroelectricity with a low-temperature process has remained a
   challenging task. In this study, the atomic layer plasma treatment
   (ALPT) technique, where an in situ Ar plasma treatment is introduced
   into each cycle of atomic layer deposition (ALD), was used to achieve
   crystallization and ferroelectricity in as-deposited ZrO2 thin films at
   a low temperature of 250 degrees C. The ALPT treatment effectively
   contributes to a high-temperature annealing effect, leading to enhanced
   crystallization and densification of the films. In addition, the ALPT
   process also induces a transformation from paraelectric to ferroelectric
   orthorhombic phase in the as-deposited ZrO2 thin films, exhibiting a
   high ferroelectric switching polarization of 30 mu C cm(-2) along with
   great endurance characteristics up to 10(8) switching cycles. This study
   demonstrates that ALPT is an effective approach to enhance and tailor
   the crystallization and dielectric characteristics of nanoscale thin
   films at a low temperature, which is highly advantageous and demanded in
   a variety of applications and research fields encompassing
   nanoelectronic, energy storage, and biomedical devices.},

Abstract = {Hafnium oxide was deposited from tetrakis(dimethylamino)hafnium (TDMAHf)
   and water by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on heated 4 `' Si wafers
   covered with native oxide in the temperature range from 100 degrees C to

   hydrogen impurity level have been realized for a substrate temperature
   of 300 degrees C. The stoichiometry of deposited films and hydrogen
   impurity level were measured by elastic recoil detection analysis. The
   hafnium to oxygen ratio showed the expected 1:2 value. Besides hydrogen,
   no other impurities could be detected. Furthermore, a strong correlation
   between the growth rate per cycle (GPC), film uniformity and level of
   hydrogen impurities was observed.
   In addition, the characterization of the crystal structure showed the
   appearance of some crystallites in an amorphous matrix already for a
   growth temperature of 250 degrees C and a pure crystalline layer at a
   growth temperature of 350 degrees C. The increased crystallinity with
   increasing growth temperature was attributed to a higher seed

Abstract = {We present a study of the physical properties of perovskite oxide
   Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 (NSMO) thin films grown on (110)-oriented SrTiO3
   substrates. In bulk form, NSMO displays coupled magnetic and electronic

   exist in an anisotropic strain state such as those obtained on
   (110)-oriented cubic substrates. In this work, resonant X-ray
   reflectivity, soft X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (X-PEEM), and
   magnetometry measurements showed that the NSMO film displays both
   vertical and lateral magnetic phase separation. Specifically, the film
   consists of three layers with different density and magnetic properties.
   The FM and AFM properties of the main NSMO layer were probed as a
   function of temperature using soft X-ray magnetic spectroscopy, and the
   coexistence of lateral FM and AFM domains was demonstrated at 110 K

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Antiferromagnets have considerable potential as spintronic materials.
   Their dynamic properties include resonant modes at frequencies higher
   than can be observed in conventional ferromagnetic materials. An
   alternative to single-phase antiferromagnets are synthetic
   antiferromagnets (SAFs), engineered structures of exchange-coupled
   ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers. SAFs have significant
   advantages due to the wide-ranging tunability of their magnetic
   properties and inherent compatibility with current device technologies,
   such as those used for Spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access
   memory production. Here we report the dynamic properties of fully
   compensated SAFs using broadband ferromagnetic resonance and demonstrate
   resonant optic modes in addition to the conventional acoustic (Kittel)
   mode. These optic modes possess the highest zero-field frequencies
   observed in SAFs to date with resonances of 18 and 21 GHz at the first
   and second peaks in antiferromagnetic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
   (RKKY) coupling, respectively. In contrast to previous SAF reports that
   focus only on the first RKKY antiferromagnetic coupling peak, we show
   that a higher optic mode frequency is obtained for the second
   antiferromagnetic coupling peak. We ascribe this to the smoother
   interfaces associated with a thicker nonmagnetic layer. This
   demonstrates the importance of interface quality to achieving
   high-frequency optic mode dynamics entering the subterahertz range.},

Abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity has been suggested to be present at the
   interface between bismuth and nickel in thin-film bilayers. In this
   work, we study the structural, magnetic, and superconducting properties
   of sputter deposited Bi/Ni bilayers. As-grown, our films do not display
   a superconducting transition; however, when stored at room temperature,
   after about 14 days our bilayers develop a superconducting transition up
   to 3.8 K. To systematically study the effect of low temperature
   annealing on our bilayers, we perform structural characterization with
   x-ray diffraction and polarized neutron reflectometry, along with
   magnetometry and low-temperature electrical transport measurements on
   samples annealed at 70 degrees C. We show that the onset of
   superconductivity in our samples is coincident with the formation of
   ordered NiBi3 intermetallic alloy, a known s-wave superconductor. We
   calculate that the annealing process has an activation energy of (0.86
   +/- 0.06) eV. As a consequence, gentle heating of the bilayers will
   cause formation of the superconducting NiBi3 at the Ni/Bi interface,
   which poses a challenge to studying any distinct properties of Bi/Ni
   bilayers without degrading that interface.},

   m. In continuous films where the surface morphology had not been
   optimised for smoothness, the topographical variation was observed to
   dominate the distribution of the magnetic transition temperatures and
   dictates the nucleation and growth of the magnetic phases. This
   observation was repeated for patterned elements, where the effects of
   surface morphology were more significant than those of spatial
   confinement. These results have clear implications for future studies of
   low-dimensional FeRh films, as surface topography must be considered

Abstract = {X-ray absorption linear dichroism of rutile TiO2 at the Ti K-edge
   provides information about the electronic states involved in the
   pre-edge transitions. Here, linear dichroism with high energy resolution
   is analyzed in combination with ab initio finite difference method
   calculations and spherical tensor analysis. It provides an assignment of
   the three pre-edge peaks beyond the octahedral crystal field splitting
   approximation and estimates the spatial extension of the corresponding
   final states. It is then discussed for the first time the X-ray
   absorption (XAS) of pentacoordinated titanium atoms due to oxygen
   vacancies and it is found that, similarly to anatase TiO2, rutile is
   expected to exhibit a transition on the low-energy side of peak A3. Its
   apparent absence in the experiment is related to the degree of p-d
   orbital mixing which is small in rutile due to its centrosymmetric point
   group. A recent XAS linear dichroism study on anatase TiO2 single
   crystals has shown that peak A2 has an intrinsic origin and is due to a
   quadrupolar transition to the 3d energy levels. In rutile, due to its
   centrosymmetric point group, the corresponding peak A2 has a small
   dipole moment explaining the weak transition. The results are confronted
   with recent picosecond X-ray absorption spectroscopy on rutile TiO(2

Abstract = {CoFeB alloys are highly relevant materials for spintronic applications.
   In this work, the crystallization of CoFeB alloys triggered by thermal
   annealing was investigated by x-ray diffraction techniques and scanning
   electron microscopy, as well as spectroscopic ellipsometry and
   magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy for annealing temperatures
   ranging from 300 to 600 degrees C. The transformation of similar to
   100-nm-thick CoxFe(80-x)B20 films from amorphous to polycrystalline was
   revealed by the sharpening of spectral features observed in optical and
   magneto-optical dielectric functions spectra. The influence of B on the
   dielectric function was assessed both experimentally and by optical
   modeling. By analyzing the Drude component of the optical dielectric
   function, a consistent trend between the charge-carrier scattering
   time/resistivity and the annealing temperature was observed, in
   agreement with the electrical investigations by means of the
   four-point-probe method.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In crystalline materials, the presence of surfaces or interfaces gives
   rise to crystal truncation rods (CTRs) in their X-ray diffraction
   patterns. While structural properties related to the bulk of a crystal
   are contained in the intensity and position of Bragg peaks in X-ray
   diffraction, CTRs carry detailed information about the atomic structure
   at the interface. Developments in synchrotron X-ray sources,
   instrumentation, and analysis procedures have made CTR measurements into
   extremely powerful tools to study atomic reconstructions and relaxations
   occurring in a wide variety of interfacial systems, with relevance to
   chemical and electronic functionalities. In this review, an overview of
   the use of CTRs in the study of atomic structure at interfaces is
   provided. The basic theory, measurement, and analysis of CTRs are
   covered and applications from the literature are highlighted.
   Illustrative examples include studies of complex oxide thin films and

Title = {Effect of strain on magnetic and orbital ordering of LaSrCrO3/LaSrMnO3
   heterostructures},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {We investigate the effect of strain and film thickness on the orbital
   and magnetic properties of LaSrCrO3 (LSCO)/LaSrMnO3 (LSMO)
   heterostructures using bulk magnetometry, soft x-ray magnetic
   spectroscopy, first-principles density-functional theory,
   high-resolution electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. We observe
   an antiparallel ordering of the magnetic moments between the
   ferromagnetic LSMO layers and the LSCO spacers, leading to a
   strain-independent ferromagnetic ground state of the LSCO/LSMO
   heterostructures for LSMO layers as thin as two unit cells. As the LSMO
   thickness is increased, a net ferromagnetic state is maintained,
   however, the average magnetic moment per Mn is found to be dependent on
   the magnitude of the substrate-induced strain. The differences in the
   magnetic responses are related to preferential occupation of the Mn x(2)
   - y(2) (in-plane) d orbitals for tensile strain and 3z(2) - r(2)
   (out-of-plane) orbitals under compressive strain, leading to competing
   ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions within the
   LSMO layers. These results underscore the relative contributions of
   orbital, structural, and spin degrees of freedom and their tunability in
   atomically thin crystalline complex oxide layers.},

Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Multilevel remanence states have potential applications in
   ultra-high-density storage and neuromorphic computing. Continuous
   tailoring of the multilevel remanence states by spin-orbit torque (SOT)
   is reported in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/IrMn heterostructures.
   Double-biased hysteresis loops with only one remanence state can be
   tuned from the positively or negatively single-biased loops by SOT
   controlled sign of the exchange-bias field. The remanence states
   associated with the heights of the sub-loops are continually changed by
   tuning the ratio of the positively and negatively oriented ferromagnetic
   domains. The multilevel storage cells are demonstrated by reading the
   remanent Hall resistance through changing the sign and/or the magnitude
   of current pulse. The synaptic plasticity behaviors for neuromorphic
   computing are also simulated by varying the remanent Hall resistance
   under the consecutive current pulses. This work demonstrates that SOT is
   an effective method to tailor the remanence states in the double-biased
   heavy metal/ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic system. The
   multilevel-stable remanence states driven by SOT show potential
   applications in future multilevel memories and neuromorphic computing
   devices.},

Abstract = {The saturation field of circular islands, consisting of

   signature of domain nucleation and evolution is observed. The changes in
   the saturation field with diameter of the islands are ascribed to the
   interplay between interlayer exchange coupling, stray field coupling at

Abstract = {Arranging molecules into highly symmetric, topological crystal
   structures has been recognized as the best approach to functionalize
   electronic properties in molecular crystals, where the constituent
   molecules have been assumed to be rigid in shape. Here, in striking
   contrast, we demonstrate that the molecules in a monolayer organic
   crystal can undergo a significant deformation in proximity to the
   substrate, which is reflected by an asymmetry in the electron density
   profile. X-ray reflectivity and X-ray absorption spectroscopies in
   conjunction with density-functional theory calculations reveal that the
   highly planarized pi-core are deformed into a bent shape, while the bulk
   lattice parameters are maintained. The molecular shape change is found
   to be perfectly suppressed in a bilayer single crystal, which leads to a
   40\% increase in mobility in the bilayer crystal. Our finding of a
   unique, sub-molecular scale shape change in monolayer single crystals
   can offer possibilities for functionalizing electrical properties via
   nano-scale physisorption.
   Organic molecules exhibit intrinsic semiconducting properties as well as
   increased flexibility in comparison to their silicon counterparts and
   consequently are playing an increasing role in semiconductor
   technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate that monolayers of organic
   crystals can undergo deformation at the molecular level when in
   proximity to a substrate and that this has an effect on their electronic
   structure.},

Abstract = {Separation of the anomalous Nernst and spin Seebeck voltages in bilayer
   devices is often problematic when both layers are metallic, and the
   anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) becomes non-negligible. Co2MnSi, a strong
   candidate for the spin generator in spin Seebeck devices, is a predicted
   half-metal with 100\% spin polarisation at the Fermi energy, however,
   typically B2 or L2(1) order is needed to achieve this. We demonstrate
   the optimisation of thin film growth of Co2MnSi on glass, where choice
   of deposition and annealing temperature can promote various ordered
   states. The contribution from the ANE is then investigated to inform
   future measurements of the spin Seebeck. A maximum ANE coefficient of
   0.662 ;V K-?1 is found for an A2 disordered polycrystalline Co2MnSi
   film. This value is comparable to ordered Heusler thin films deposited
   onto single crystal substrates but obtained at a far lower fabrication

Abstract = {Using in situ polarized neutron reflectometry, the depth-resolved
   evolution of the magnetism and structure in a Pd/Fe/Pd trilayer thin
   film is measured during growth. The initial film structure of Pd/Fe
   shows a small proximity-induced magnetism in the underlayer and a
   magnetization in the Fe layer of approximate to 1.6 mu(B) per Fe atom,
   less than the expected bulk value of 2.2 mu(B). Deposition of the Pd
   capping layer initially follows an islandlike growth mode with
   subsequent coalescence. With increasing Pd deposition the Fe moment and
   the proximity-induced magnetism in the Pd capping layer decrease. After
   final deposition of the Pd capping layer, the magnetic profile is
   structurally and magnetically symmetric across the Fe layer, with
   magnetism induced in Pd up to 0.92 nm from the interface. Throughout the
   Pd deposition the Pd/Fe/Pd trilayer structure is becoming increasingly
   symmetric, a fact which points to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as
   a likely cause of the observed magnetic behavior.},

Abstract = {The perovskite crystal structure is known to exhibit a multitude of
   interesting physical phenomena owing to the intricate coupling of the
   electronic and magnetic properties to the structure. Fluoroperovskites
   offer an alternative chemistry to the much more widely studied oxide
   materials, which may prove advantageous for applications. It is

   perovskite fluoride, NaNiF3, can be synthesized in thin film form. The
   films were grown via molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3 (100) substrates
   to produce high quality epitaxial films in the thickness range of 5-50
   nm. The Pnma structure of the films was confirmed by x-ray diffraction.
   There was a decrease in the out-of-plane lattice spacing from the bulk
   value corresponding to a maximum strain of 1.7\% in the thinnest film.
   Canted antiferromagnetism was measured in all films using magnetometry
   and a negative change in the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of
   Delta T-N = - 9.1 +/- 0.7 K was observed with increasing strain.},

Abstract = {Magnetic Heusler alloys X(2)BZ (where X and B are 3d elements and Z
   belongs to the sp group) exhibit diverse magnetic and structural
   properties, which are important for designing multifunctional smart
   materials. Electronic band structure calculations demonstrate that, if
   the valence of element B is higher than that of element X, such alloys
   (so-called inverse Heusler alloys) can behave differently as compared to
   traditional Heusler alloys. The growth, the crystal structure, and the
   magnetic properties of thin films of a new Mn2FeSi Heusler alloy
   deposited under various conditions (including various substrates and
   annealing temperatures) are studied in this work. A temperature-induced
   structural transition into a low-magnetization martensitic phase and a
   thermally stable austenitic phase are detected. A magnetic field of 500
   Oe applied to some samples at a temperature of 380 K is found to cause a
   large exchange bias (about 1 kOe) at T = 10 K. The influence of the type
   of substrate and the annealing temperature on the magnetic and

Title = {Model calibration using a parallel differential evolution algorithm in
   computational neuroscience: Simulation of stretch induced nerve deficit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is
   one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults
   worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a
   mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional
   deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled
   electrophysiological-mechanical model with several free parameters that
   are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The
   calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm
   (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration
   of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several
   minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter
   tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a
   simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The
   model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more
   realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to
   run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a
   parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor
   taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel
   DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort
   achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time.
   While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the
   resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve
   damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration
   in a bundle. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of
   dye molecules adsorbed onto nanoparticles of a semiconductor such as
   TiO2. A reliable prediction of the DSSC photovoltaic performance of a
   given dye requires in-depth knowledge about the precise structure of the
   dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interface. X-ray reflectometry
   (XRR) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) are
   herein employed to determine the dye center dot center dot center dot
   TiO2 interfacial structure and associated dye aggregation behavior of
   three high-performance DSSC dyes, i.e., a metal-free organic dye, MK-2,
   and the two archetypal ruthenium-based organometallic dyes, N3 and N749
   (Black Dye). Results show that all three dyes form nanoaggregates in dye
   center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces. We determine the dye
   nanoaggregate separations, sizes, distribution densities, and the extent
   of short-range order within each dye self-assembly in the longitudinal
   and lateral directions. Dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2
   composites fabricated using dye solutions of varying concentrations are
   analyzed. We find that nanoaggregates of the three dyes are separated by
   several hundred nanometers (158-203 nm) in dye center dot center dot
   center dot TiO2 interfaces that have been fabricated using concentrated
   dye solutions (0.5 mM or 1.0 mM). MK-2 and N749 dyes also display
   smaller interparticle separations. Dye nanoparticle diameters are of the
   order of 156-198 nm, sizes that are comparable to the largest
   interparticle separations. Thus, no extraneous dye particles can be
   fitted into gaps between particles, so the dye self-assembly is
   saturated. Self-assemblies of all three dyes exhibit both lateral and
   longitudinal short-range order; N3 displays a particularly short
   coherence length along the TiO2 surface, with extensive structured
   disorder along the longitudinal direction. The operation of DSSC working
   electrodes would therefore seem to be dependent on a dye self-assembly
   that may exhibit several levels of structural granularity and dye
   aggregation effects.},

Abstract = {Behaviour of interface properties and propagation of interfacial atomic
   diffusion have been investigated systematically in Co/Ti multilayers
   with ultra-short (similar to 18 angstrom) bi-layer thickness. Co/Ti
   multilayers with 10,20,40,60 and 80 bi-layers have been grown using an
   indigenously built in-line dc magnetron sputtering system having
   application as reflecting optics in the water window soft X-ray regime
   of 23-44 angstrom. Specular and diffused Grazing Incidence X-ray
   reflectivity measurements with hard X-rays have been used to evaluate
   detailed interfacial structure of the multilayers. It is observed that
   interfacial atomic diffusion of Co into Ti layers is significant in such
   ultra-short period multilayer structures and it increases as more number
   of layers are added in the multilayer stack. As a result of Co diffusion
   into Ti the physical density of Ti layer increases and also effective
   thickness of Co layer decreases. Since the thickness of the Ti layers
   are in sub-nm range, it is found that this diffusion is not limited only
   to the interface region of Co-on-Ti, rather it spreads throughout the
   bulk of Ti layer. Finally, soft X-ray reflectivity measurement on the
   multilayers with synchrotron radiation at 28 angstrom wavelength shows
   that the peak reflectivity is limited by the significant diffusion at
   the Co/Ti interfaces.},

Journal = {PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For HfO2-based films, which are mainly prepared by atomic layer
   deposition, the desired ferroelectric (FE) properties typically vanish
   while extending the thickness beyond a limit of about 50 nm. Herein, the
   successful fabrication of a 1 mu m-thick piezoelectric La:HfO2 film is
   demonstrated using chemical solution deposition, paving the way toward
   sensor and actuator applications. After identifying the optimal La
   content, the film thickness is increased from 45 nm to 1 mu m.
   Polarization and strain measurements evidence the persistence of the FE
   properties at all thicknesses and even a slight improvement due to a
   better orientation of the polar axis at higher thicknesses. Scanning
   electron microscopy and X-ray reflectivity reveal a fine-grained
   microstructure and a density of only 80\% of the theoretical value,
   which seems to be a common issue of solution-deposited HfO2-based films,
   based on the performed literature survey. Using tilt-angle-dependent
   X-ray diffraction scans, homogeneous nucleation is found to be the
   likely root cause of the observed microstructure. It is suggested that
   this microstructure issue is key for the optimization of cycling
   stability of solution-based films to exploit the full potential of the
   HfO2 for cost-efficient, thick piezoelectric films.},

Abstract = {The vertical composition distribution of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ)
   photoactive layer is known to have dramatic effects on photovoltaic
   performance in polymer solar cells. However, the vertical composition
   distribution evolution rules of BHJ films are still elusive. In this
   contribution, three BHJ film systems, composed of polymer donor PBDB-T,
   and three different classes of acceptor (fullerene acceptor PCBM,
   small-molecule acceptor ITIC, and polymer acceptor N2200) are
   systematically investigated using neutron reflectometry to examine how
   donor acceptor interaction and solvent additive impact the vertical
   composition distribution. Our results show that those three BHJ films
   possess homogeneous vertical composition distributions across the bulk
   of the film, while very different composition accumulations near the top
   and bottom surface were observed, which could be attributed to different
   repulsion, miscibility, and phase separation between the donor and
   acceptor components as approved by the measurement of the donor acceptor
   Flory Huggins interaction parameter chi. Moreover, the solvent additive
   1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) can induce more distinct vertical composition
   distribution especially in nonfullerene acceptor-based BHJ films. Thus,
   higher power conversion efficiencies were achieved in inverted solar
   cells because of facilitated charge transport in the active layer,
   improved carrier collection at electrodes, and suppressed charge
   recombination in BHJ solar cells.},

Abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials as active components in spintronic devices
   promise insensitivity against external magnetic fields, the absence of
   own magnetic stray fields, and ultrafast dynamics at the picosecond time
   scale. Materials with certain crystal symmetry show an intrinsic
   Neel-order spin-orbit torque that can efficiently switch the magnetic
   order of an antiferromagnet. The tetragonal variant of CuMnAs has been
   shown to be electrically switchable by this intrinsic spin-orbit effect
   and its use in memory cells with memristive properties has recently been
   demonstrated for high-quality films grown using molecular-beam epitaxy.
   Here, we demonstrate that the magnetic order of magnetron-sputtered
   CuMnAs films can also be manipulated by electrical current pulses. The
   switching efficiency and relaxation as a function of the temperature,
   the current density, and the pulse width can be described by a
   thermal-activation model. Our findings demonstrate that CuMnAs can be

Abstract = {The fabrication of epitaxial, ultrathin SrTiO3 (STO) on thick SiO2
   without the need for complicated wafer-bonding processes has been
   demonstrated. The resulting transition metal oxide (TMO)-on-glass layer
   stack is analogous to traditional silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers,
   where the crystalline device silicon layer of SOI has been replaced by a
   crystalline functional TMO layer. Fabrication starts with ultrathin body
   SOI on which crystalline STO is grown epitaxially by molecular beam
   epitaxy. The device silicon layer is subsequently fully oxidized by ex
   situ high-temperature dry O-2 annealing, as confirmed by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray reflectivity, and high-resolution
   electron microscopy. STO maintains its epitaxial registry to the carrier
   silicon substrate after annealing, and no evidence for degradation of
   the STO crystalline quality as a result of the TMO-on-glass fabrication
   process is observed. The ease of fabricating the TMO-on-glass platform
   without the need for wafer bonding will enable rapid progress in the
   development of state-of-the-art TMO-based electronic and photonic
   devices.},

Abstract = {Aluminum nitride (AlN) films with controlled oxygen content were

   optimized for ultraviolet-A reflectivity were fabricated with pairs of

Abstract = {The interface roughness of supermirrors with m = 4 times the critical
   angle of nickel has been investigated by the reflection of x-rays from
   the back side of the mirrors. Reflectivity measurements from the front
   side do not contain useful information about the morphology of the
   layers because most photons are totally reflected from the top layer,
   which has typically a thickness of approximately 80 nm. Therefore, it is
   not straightforward to obtain information about the interface roughness
   of the layers underneath, which are decisive for the reflectivity of the
   supermirrors. In contrast, specular and off-specular measurements from
   the back side provide quantitative information on the buildup of
   roughness at the interfaces as well as the lateral and vertical
   correlation lengths of the roughness. As the intensity of laboratory
   x-ray sources is much higher than the intensity of neutron beams, it is
   possible to probe up to 8 harmonics of the supermirror sequence
   corresponding to m = 32. We demonstrate that the sheets caused by
   resonant diffuse scattering off supermirrors with a high reflectivity
   have a lower intensity and larger lateral correlation lengths than
   mirrors with a low reflectivity. We show that the reflection of x-rays
   from the back side of supermirrors is an alternative method for their
   characterization.},

Abstract = {We report on the influence of oxygen partial pressure for the

   the change in oxide thickness, chemical composition, and the lateral
   distribution of alloying elements. The impact of the oxygen chemical
   potential is most visible at high temperatures where the oxide
   composition changes from mostly Al based to mostly Mg based. This is in
   stark contrast to the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions where only a
   partial compositional transition is observed. The microscopy data
   demonstrate that in the UHV case, Mg segregation onto the surface occurs
   firstly at grain boundaries at 300 degrees C and secondly at sites over
   the entire surface at 400 degrees C. Further, the initial oxide
   thickness is 45 angstrom, as determined by XPS and XRR, decreases in all
   observed cases after heating to 300 degrees C. At higher temperatures,
   however, the oxygen partial pressure highly influences the resulting
   oxide thickness as evident from our X-ray reflectivity data.},

Title = {Effect of interfacial interdiffusion on magnetism in epitaxial Fe4N
   films on LaAlO3 substrates},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Epitaxial Fe4N thin films grown on LaAlO3 (LAO) substrate using
   sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy techniques have been studied in
   this work. Within the sputtering process, films were grown with
   conventional direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and using a high
   power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) process. Surface morphology
   and depth profile studies on these samples reveal that HiPIMS deposited
   film has the lowest roughness, the highest packing density, and the
   sharpest interface. We found that the substrate-film interface and the
   microstructure play a vital role in affecting the electronic
   hybridization and magnetic properties of Fe4N films. La from the LAO
   substrate and Fe from the film interdiffuse and form an undesired
   interface. The magnetic moment (M-s) was compared using bulk,
   element-specific and magnetic depth profiling techniques. We found that
   M-s was the highest when the thickness of the interdiffused layer was
   lowest and such conditions can only be achieved in the HiPIMS grown
   samples. The presence of a small moment at the N site was also evidenced
   by element-specific x-ray circular dichroism measurement in the HiPIMS
   grown sample. A large variation in the M-s values of Fe4N films found in
   the experimental works carried out so far could be due to such an
   interdiffused layer which is generally not expected to form in otherwise
   stable oxide substrate at a low substrate temperature approximate to
   675K. In addition, a consequence of substrate-film interdiffusion and
   microstructure resulted in the different kinds of magnetic anisotropies
   in Fe4N films grown using different techniques. A detailed investigation
   of the substrate-film interface and microstructure on the magnetization
   of Fe4N film is presented and discussed in this work.},

Title = {Maximization of ferromagnetism in LaCoO3 films by competing symmetry},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Spin state transition in perovskite cobaltite is delicately controlled
   by the competition between exchange interaction energy and crystal-field
   energy. The latter is mainly governed by the change of bond length and
   bonding angle. Previous work has revealed that the electronic
   configuration associated with spin state transition in LaCoO3 (LCO) thin
   films can be effectively modulated by epitaxial strain. However, a
   systematic study on the spin state transition of Co3+ ions in LCO films
   with different crystallographic symmetry is still missing. Here, keeping
   the in-plane strain unchanged, we report that the magnetization of LCO
   films can be manipulated with crystallographic symmetry. The ultrathin
   LCO layers, constrained by the cubic substrate, have pseudotetragonal
   structure and small magnetization. Upon increasing the layer thickness,
   the monoclinic structure dominates the LCO film and maximizes its
   ferromagnetism. For the LCO films with a thickness beyond 35 unit cells,
   the symmetry relaxes gradually towards its rhombohedral bulk form, and
   meanwhile the magnetization reduces. These results highlight the
   importance of spin-lattice entanglement in a ferroelastic material and
   provide a concise way to maximize its functionality using symmetry
   engineering.},

   either the silicate tetrahedra or the ditrigonal cavities of the
   underlying muscovite surface. High-resolution atomic force microscopy

Abstract = {An atomic layer deposition (ALD) process is reported for the growth of
   nanoscale PrAlO3 thin films for two-dimensional electronics and memory
   device applications using tris(isopropylcyclopentadienyl)- praseodymium
   (Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3)), trimethylaluminum (AlMe3), and water.
   Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) was first evaluated as a precursor for the formation
   of thin films of the binary oxide Pr2O3 by using water as the
   coreactant. Self-limited growth of Pr2O3 was demonstrated for pulse
   lengths of >= 3 s, with a growth rate of similar to 0.85 angstrom/cycle.
   The ALD growth of PrAlO3 films was examined on Si, thermal SiO2, and
   (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Self-limited growth was demonstrated
   for Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3), AlMe3, and water at 300 degrees C by using a 1:1
   ratio of the number of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses. An ALD
   window was observed from 275 to 325 degrees C with a growth rate of
   similar to 1.7 angstrom/cycle. The as-deposited PrAlO3 films on all
   substrates were amorphous, had smooth surfaces, and contained <0.5\%
   carbon, as analyzed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering,
   X-ray reflectivity, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively.
   Films grown with a 1:1 ratio of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses were
   aluminum-rich (Pr:Al similar to 1:1.2-1.4). Heating PrAlO3 layers
   deposited on SrTiO3 to 800 degrees C for 3 h resulted in fully
   crystallized PrAlO3 films. The crystallized PrAlO3 films were highly
   (001)-oriented. The PrAlO3 00L and SrTiO3 00L reflections appeared on
   the same rod of reciprocal space, further indicating that the amorphous
   PrAlO3 film transforms into an epitaxial layer. The rocking curve width
   of the PrAlO3 (001) reflection was 7 degrees. By contrast, PrAlO3 films
   deposited on Si substrates with native oxide remained amorphous after
   annealing at 1000 degrees C for 8 h. The difference in the
   crystallization between PrAlO3 layers deposited on crystalline SrTiO3
   and amorphous native SiO2 substrates indicates that PrAlO3 on SrTiO3
   crystallized by solid-phase epitaxy, in which the nucleation and
   orientation of the crystallized layer are set by the atomic
   configuration at the substrate-film interface.},

   diffusion of Ni/Ti periodic multilayers and supermirrors},
Journal = {VACUUM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {169},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Interface roughness and interface diffusion are two very crucial
   parameters in determining the performances of thin film multilayer
   devices for applications in X-ray optics, neutron optics, giant magneto
   resistance devices etc. Preparation of these thin film multilayers with
   sharp interfaces is a technological challenge and researchers are using
   different methods to reduce the interface imperfections. It has been
   observed that by mixing nitrogen with argon in sputtering ambience
   during deposition of Ni layers, neutron reflectivity of Ni/Ti neutron
   supermirrors can be improved significantly.To elucidate the physical
   mechanism behind this observation, two sets of Ni/Ti periodic
   multilayers have been prepared using an indigenously built in-line
   magnetron sputtering system, in one set pure Ar has been used in
   sputtering ambience and in the other set a mixed ambience of Ar + N-2
   has been used for deposition of Ni layers. Both the sets of multilayers
   have been thoroughly characterized by specular and diffused Grazing
   Incidence X-ray Reflectivity, Nuclear Resonance Reaction, X-ray
   diffraction and Grazing Incidence Extended X-ray Absorption Fine
   Structure measurements using synchrotron radiation. All the above
   complementary measurements unambiguously establish that the reason for
   improved performance of the supermirror deposited with Ar + N-2 ambience
   is the reduction of interface diffusion at Ti-on-Ni interfaces.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {489},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {We reviewed magnetic tetra metal nitrides - Fe4N and Co4N for their
   structure, magnetization and the thermodynamics of phase formation.
   Opposed to Fe4N, the formation of a stoichiometric Co4N turns out to be
   extremely difficult. A review of the literature of Co4N compound suggest
   that the experimental lattice parameter (LP) was always found to be
   smaller than the theoretical predicted value. It can also be seen that
   as the substrate temperature (T-s) increases, the LP of Co4N film
   decreases. In this work, we deposited Co4N films using molecular beam
   epitaxy (MBE), direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and high power
   impulse MS (HiPIMS). Films were characterized using X-ray diffraction,
   X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. It was found that at
   high T-s, N out-diffusion significantly affects the growth of Co4N
   phase. We found that the MBE deposited films did not show any signature
   of Co4N phase when T-s < 703 K but at T-s = 703 K, the phase formed can
   be assigned to fcc Co rather than Co4N. On the other hand, the dcMS and
   HiPIMS grown films clearly show the presence of Co4N phase even at T-s =
   300 K. Detailed analysis of Co4N films grown using dcMS and HiPIMS
   reveals that HiPIMS grown films are single phase and have a denser
   microstructure. The density of HiPIMS deposited film was also found to
   be close to the theoretical value. Magneto optical Kerr effect and
   polarized neutron reflectivity measurements were carried out to study
   magnetic properties. Differences in the magnetic moment and magnetic
   anisotropy were correlated with structural parameters. Obtained results
   are presented and discussed in terms of involved thin film growth
   mechanism.},

Abstract = {Thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of the Ag/diamond and Au/diamond
   interfaces with a nanometer-thick interface layer of either nickel or
   molybdenum is measured by time domain thermoreflectance and modeled
   based on a 3-layer two-temperature model (3l-TTM). The rationale for
   this study is to critically assess the role of the electron-phonon
   coupling factor of the interlayer along with its thickness on the TBC.
   It is shown that the TBC of both systems rapidly increases with the
   interlayer thickness until reaching a stable plateau for thicknesses
   greater than 1.5 nm. The plateau average value is 15\%-25\% lower than
   the intrinsic TBC between the interlayer material and the diamond
   substrate. This behavior and values of the TBC of both systems are in
   good agreement with the predictions of the 3l-TTM. The predictability of
   this model is also analyzed for a Cu interlayer inserted at Au/silicon
   interfaces with thicknesses ranging from 1.5 to 20 nm. While the room
   temperature TBC of this system is well described by the 3l-TTM, the
   values measured at 80 K can only be predicted by the 3l-TTM, provided
   that the interlayer electron-phonon coupling factor is reduced by a
   factor of 2, as was experimentally observed for Ag and Au. The obtained
   experimental results along with the proposed model can thus be useful
   for tailoring the TBC of metallic interfaces in a wide range of
   temperatures. Published under license by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {This work aims at experimentally assessing the effect of structural
   disorder and/or chemical interdiffusion on thermal boundary conductance
   (TBC) at metal/dielectric interfaces. To this end, the TBC of Au/Si and
   Ti/Si interfaces was measured by time domain thermoreflectance in the
   as-deposited state and after various heat treatments. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the structure of the
   interface for each heat treatment condition. The TBC at the Au/Si
   interface was found to be highest in the as-deposited state and to be
   somewhat reduced after heat treatments. TEM images showed that the
   highest TBC was obtained when the interface contained a disordered
   transition layer with some degree of interdiffusion as present in the
   as-deposited state. Heat treatments led to the separation of species and
   to more abrupt interfaces with lower TBC. Whether this change in TBC was
   linked to disorder or to interdiffusion could not be distinguished. The
   TBC at the Ti/Si interfaces was observed to decrease with the heat
   treatment duration. TEM investigations revealed the presence of a thin
   disordered layer that did not evolve much with heat treatments. The
   evolution of the TBC was hence rationalized by interdiffusion
   facilitated by heat treatments that most likely modified the diffusion
   zone thickness and chemical composition, as well as the disordered
   layer's chemical composition. These changes result in modified
   interfacial properties, which ultimately affect the TBC. A quantitative
   exploration of the TBC dependence on the composition was not possible in
   this work, due to the extreme thinness of the regions under
   consideration preventing any reliable STEM-energy dispersive x-ray
   measurement. Published under license by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {In this study, we combine low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) static and

   Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ta films of various thicknesses, followed by exposure to
   atomic oxygen at room temperature (similar to 20 degrees C). A method
   for nondestructive determination of the oxide growth rate via LEIS
   static depth profiling (static DP) is presented in detail. This method
   shows high sensitivity to the oxide thickness formed, and the results
   are in agreement with those obtained by X-ray reflectometry and sputter
   depth profiling (sputter DP). Sequential exposures of oxygen isotopes in
   combination with LEIS sputter DP are applied to elucidate the growth
   mechanism of the oxide films. The results indicate that the oxidation
   kinetics at the applied experimental conditions is directly influenced
   by the metal work function, characterizing a Cabrera-Mott growth type.
   The maximum thickness of the formed oxide and oxide growth rate are in
   the order Zr approximate to Ta > Mo > Ru. The combining of analysis by
   LEIS static DP and isotope tracing sputter DP is decisive in the
   characterization of oxidation kinetics in the room temperature regime.

Abstract = {Magnetic rare-earth/nonmagnetic metal superlattices are well-known to
   display chiral spin helices in the rare-earth layers that propagate
   coherently across the nonmagnetic layers. However, the underlying
   mechanism that preserves the magnetic phase and chirality coherence
   across the nonmagnetic layers has remained elusive. In this paper, we
   use resonant and element-specific x-ray scattering to evidence directly
   the formation of two fundamentally different long-range modulations in a
   holmium/yttrium (Ho/Y) multilayer: the known Ho chiral spin helix with
   periodicity 25 angstrom and a newly observed charge density wave with
   periodicity 16 angstrom that propagates through both the Ho and
   nonmagnetic Y layer. With x-ray circular magnetic dichroism measurements
   ruling out the existence of a magnetic proximity effect induced moment
   in the nonmagnetic Y layers, we propose that the charge density wave is
   also chiral, thus providing the means for the transmittance of magnetic
   chirality coherence between Ho layers.},

Abstract = {The improving efficiency in obtaining renewable energy has promoted the
   deployment of electronic systems in the area of limited wired
   power-supply, whereas the use of devices with reduced threshold-voltage
   and power-consumption is essential for guaranteeing continuous working
   capability. Herein, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was optimized by introducing Ge for
   high-speed and low-energy phase change memory (PCM) application. The
   high speed of 10 ns and the low threshold voltage of 1.6 V have been
   achieved, originating from the crystal-like octahedral motifs in the
   amorphous phase, in which crystallization can be accomplished by the
   shifting or rotation of these motifs. The good endurance of 10(5) cycles
   is due to the small volume change of 4.6\% and the formation of a
   homogenous phase during crystallization, which reduces the risk of
   stress- and segregation-induced device failure. The nucleation-dominated
   crystallization behavior of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is observed, where the Ge
   atoms with lowest electronegativity are preferred to occupy the center
   cation layers in the nonuple-layer block, whereas the less metallic Bi
   and Sb atoms sit on the edged cation layers. The high-speed, low
   threshold voltage, and low power consumption have made the
   Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM film a promising candidate for application in
   self-powered electronic systems, i.e. Internet of Things systems with
   solar energy supply.},

Abstract = {We present the full investigation of the atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   of a mixed rhenium-aluminum oxide, namely ReAl2O3CH3, a material with
   tunable resistance, comprising the building unit of conductive rhenium
   oxides, ReOx. The deposition, involving methyltrioxorhenium(VII)
   (MeReO3, MTO) and trimethylaluminum (TMA), was analyzed by employing
   complementary in situ diagnostic quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM),
   Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and quadrupole mass
   spectrometry (QMS) to explore and reveal the underlying growth mechanism
   of this material. A proposed mechanism includes reductive elimination
   steps, thereby creating a stable Re(III)-containing thin film, making
   this ALD process unique regarding its growth. In addition, as proven by
   QMS, the surface reactions include the formation of hydrogen and
   unsaturated hydrocarbons. From this straightforward process, an
   extraordinarily high growth rate of 4.5 angstrom cycle(-1) at
   temperatures as low as 150 degrees C was obtained. This material was
   found to exhibit highly promising electrical properties in terms of low
   thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR) in combination with high
   resistivity. By blending thin films of ReAl2O3CH3 with additional layers
   (1, 2, or 3) of Al2O3, we were able to fine-tune the electrical
   resistivity in the range of 3.9 x 10(6) -1.5 x 10(11) Omega.cm.
   Simultaneously, the TCR was lowered to about -0.014 degrees C--1,C-
   making this material highly resistive over a broad temperature range and
   a promising candidate for advanced detector applications, e.g.,
   multichannel plates (MCPs).},

Abstract = {y The first order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic metamagnetic phase
   transition of equiatomic FeRh offers new opportunities for novel
   antiferromagnetic memories and spintronic devices with the caveat that
   it can be utilized in thin film structures (<50 nm). Here, we report a
   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) study for three representative film
   thicknesses (5, 20, and 50 nm) aimed at determining the physical and
   magnetic structure of FeRh at room temperature and partway through the
   transition. The PNR results are analyzed with reference to X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy data which
   together provide a consistent description of the magnetic and physical
   state of the FeRh thin films. The data demonstrate that the nucleation
   of the ferromagnetic phase initiates at the MgO substrate, and results
   from structural and magnetic measurements demonstrate that the magnetic
   behavior and strain properties of FeRh correlate with the evolving
   topography of the three films investigated. (C) 2019 Author(s).},

Abstract = {Current induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in perpendicularly magnetized
   heavy metal/ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal trilayers has been widely
   studied to achieve the current-induced magnetization switching.
   Decreasing the critical switching current-density (J(C)) is a primary
   factor in the performance of memory or logic devices because J(C)
   directly affects the power consumption of the devices. This work
   demonstrates the influences of inserting a transition metal copper (Cu)
   layer between the Co/Ta interface in the Pt/Co/Ta structures with
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) on the J(C), SOT, coercive
   field, and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field (H-an). The results
   show that J(C) decreases significantly when the thickness of Cu layer is
   above 3 nm, compared with the Pt/Co/Ta control sample, under
   consideration of the shunting effect of Cu layer. The decrease of J(C)
   is the result of the competition between the modified SOT and H-an due
   to the insertion of Cu. The study suggests that the critical switching
   current-density of SOT-switching can be decreased by inserting a
   transition metal Cu layer.},

Abstract = {The depth-dependent magnetization in thin film oxygen stoichiometric and
   oxygen-deficient La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 is investigated by using polarized
   neutron reflectivity and DC bulk magnetometry. The polarized neutron
   reflectivity results reveal that the stoichiometric sample shows
   enhanced interfacial magnetization relative to the rest of the film. The
   oxygen-deficient sample exhibits a reduced average magnetization from
   the optimized recipe. Both films show regions of suppressed
   magnetization at the surface regardless of the growth pressure. The
   oxygen stoichiometric film does not show an interfacial dead layer,
   whereas the oxygen-deficient film exhibits a dead layer whose thickness
   changes with temperature. At a low applied field, we observe striking
   differences in the depth dependence of the magnetic ordering, with the
   oxygen-deficient film exhibiting exchange spring behavior, while the
   stoichiometric film shows a constant magnetization direction across the
   film. These results suggest that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies
   during growth leads to an accumulation of vacancies at the interface,
   which is enhanced at higher temperature due to increased oxygen
   mobility, creating a region of reduced magnetism that couples to the
   rest of the film. These results offer insight into the complex behavior
   and role of oxygen vacancies in the magnetism of these systems.
   Additionally, the study reveals further details of the negative
   magnetization in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 reported in previous studies, which are

Abstract = {Recently, topotactic fluorination has become an alternative way of
   doping epitaxial perovskite oxides through anion substitution to
   engineer their electronic properties instead of the more commonly used
   cation substitution. In this work, epitaxial oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta
   F gamma films were synthesized via topotactic fluorination of SrMnO2.5
   films using polytetrafluoroethylene as the fluorine source. Oxidized
   SrMnO3 films were also prepared for comparison with the fluorinated
   samples. The F content, probed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, was
   systematically controlled by adjusting fluorination conditions.
   Electronic transport measurements reveal that increased F content (up to
   gamma = 0.14) systematically increases the electrical resistivity,
   despite the nominal electron-doping induced by F substitution for O in
   these films. In contrast, oxidized SrMnO3 exhibits a decreased
   resistivity and conduction activation energy. A blue-shift of optical
   absorption features occurs with increasing F content. Density functional
   theory calculations indicate that F acts as a scattering center for
   electronic transport, controls the observed weak ferromagnetic behavior
   of the films, and reduces the inter-band optical transitions in the
   manganite films. These results stand in contrast to bulk electron-doped
   La(1-x)Ce(x)Mno(3), illustrating how aliovalent anionic substitutions
   can yield physical behavior distinct from A-site substituted perovskites
   with the same nominal B-site oxidation states.},

Title = {Studying Hemoglobin and a Bare Metal-Porphyrin Complex Immobilized on

Abstract = {We evaluate here, using synchrotron X-ray reflectivity, hemoglobin
   adsorption characteristics on silicon substrates with varying chemical
   functionalities. Hemoglobin at isoelectronic point and at negative
   charge is immobilized on functionalized hydrophilic (hydroxyl,
   carboxylic, amine) and hydrophobic (alkylated) silicon surfaces for the
   study. As a control, the bare cofactor hemin (containing only the metal
   and porphyrin with no amino acid residues) is also studied under similar
   conditions. Ordered layers (grown using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique)
   are observed to be less affected by the surface chemistry compared to
   the multilayers formed by physical absorption. Surface chemistry and
   charge of the proteins are critical in controlling the protein
   adsorption characteristics on silicon, such as thickness (correlated to
   molecule size) and roughness. In this study, this is very well realized
   by varying both the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the substrate.
   The fundamental studies discussed here provide us with a set of
   important guidelines as to how electrode surface functionalization can
   control molecular conformation/orientation, especially protein
   adsorption on the substrate. This in turn is expected to have a
   significant impact on the protein electrochemical function and response
   of biomolecular devices.},

Title = {Stabilization of epsilon-Fe2O3 epitaxial layer on MgO(111)/GaN via an
   intermediate gamma-phase},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {In the present study we have demonstrated epitaxial stabilization of the
   metastable magnetically hard epsilon-Fe2O3 phase on top of a thin
   MgO(111) buffer layer grown onto the GaN (0001) surface. The primary
   purpose to introduce a 4-nm-thick buffer layer of MgO in between Fe2O3
   and GaN was to stop thermal migration of Ga into the iron oxide layer.
   Though such migration and successive formation of the orthorhombic
   GaFeO3 was supposed earlier to be a potential trigger of the nucleation
   of the isostructural epsilon-Fe2O3, the present work demonstrates that
   the growth of single crystalline uniform films of epsilon ferrite by
   pulsed laser deposition is possible even on the MgO capped GaN. The
   structural properties of the 60-nm-thick Fe2O3 layer on MgO/GaN were
   probed by electron and x-ray diffraction, both suggesting that the
   growth of epsilon-Fe2O3 is preceded by formation of a thin layer of
   gamma-Fe2O3. The presence of the magnetically hard epsilon ferrite was
   independently confirmed by temperature dependent magnetometry
   measurements. The depth-resolved x-ray and polarized neutron
   reflectometry reveal that the 10 nm iron oxide layer at the interface
   has a lower density and a higher magnetization than the main volume of
   the epsilon-Fe2O3 film. The density and magnetic moment depth profiles
   derived from fitting the reflectometry data are in a good agreement with
   the presence of the magnetically degraded gamma-Fe2O3 transition layer
   between MgO and epsilon-Fe2O3. The natural occurrence of the interface
   between magnetoelectric epsilon- and spin caloritronic gamma-iron oxide
   phases can enable further opportunities to design novel
   all-oxide-on-semiconductor devices.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The authors report epitaxial BaSnO3(001) and SrSnO3(001) growth on
   SrTiO3(001) (STO) substrates via atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 180
   degrees C, where the BaSnO3 growth rate is 0.46 +/- 0.03 angstrom and
   the SrSnO3 growth rate is 0.69 +/- 0.04 angstrom per ALD unit cycle.
   Reflection high-energy electron diffraction, x-ray diffraction (XRD),
   and rocking curve analyses verify the single crystalline nature of
   BaSnO3(001) and SrSnO3(001) thin films on STO(001), while the atomic
   force microscopy analyses reveal the smooth surface of the stannate
   films with rms roughness values of similar to 0.4 nm, which is only
   slightly higher than the STO substrate roughness of 0.32 nm.
   Out-of-plane XRD and reciprocal space mapping show that both BaSnO3(001)
   and SrSnO3(001) (similar to 10 nm) are fully relaxed on STO(001), owing
   to the large lattice mismatches (5.1\% for BaSnO3/STO and 3.2\% for
   SrSnO3/STO). The visible light transmittance spectra indicate that
   ALD-grown BaSnO3 and SrSnO3 thin films have high transparency at 400-800
   nm that matches the transparency of STO(001) substrates.},

Abstract = {In the epitaxial barium zirconate (BaZrO3) thin films deposited on
   NdGaO3 substrates through pulsed laser deposition, the large lattice
   mismatch between film and substrate can be accommodated by generating a
   large amount of misfit dislocations at the interface. With careful
   structural and chemical analyses, an enhancement in barium vacancy
   concentration together with charge compensating oxygen vacancies is
   believed to be formed near the dislocation defects, which should be
   mainly responsible for the great improvement of the proton conductivity.
   However, the crystallinity deteriorates with increasing film thickness
   due to the dislocations propagation. Such behavior could lead to a
   detrimental impact on the proton transport properties. These results
   could be useful for rational design of coating electrolytes with high
   proton conductivity by strain engineering for in-plane solid oxide fuel
   cell applications.},

   Here we studied by means of grazing incidence x-ray diffraction and

   cubic lattice with the presence of two twins. The Co overlayer,
   presenting a polycrystalline hexagonal close packed structure with
   stacking faults, induces an amorphization of the topmost C-60 layers.
   Most importantly, we observe a deep diffusion of Co atoms in the
   octahedral sites of the crystallized C-60 film which could strongly
   affect the spin transport properties of the molecular layer and thus the
   magnetoresistance of the final device.},

Title = {Modification of spin-ice physics in Ho2Ti2O7 thin films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {We present an extensive study on the effect of substrate orientation,
   strain, stoichiometry, and defects on spin-ice physics in Ho2Ti2O7 thin
   films grown onto yttria-stabilized-zirconia substrates. We find that
   growth in different orientations produces different strain states in the
   films. All films exhibit similar c-axis lattice parameters for their
   relaxed portions, which are consistently larger than the bulk value of
   10.1 angstrom. Transmission electron microscopy reveals antisite
   disorder and growth defects to be present in the films, but evidence of
   stuffing is not observed. The amount of disorder depends on the growth
   orientation, with the (110) film showing the least. Magnetization
   measurements at 1.8 K show the expected magnetic anisotropy and
   saturation magnetization values associated with a spin ice for all
   orientations; shape anisotropy is apparent when comparing in- and
   out-of-plane directions. Significantly, only the (110)-oriented films
   display the hallmark spin-ice plateau state in magnetization, albeit
   less well defined compared to the plateau observed in a single crystal.
   Neutron-scattering maps on the more disordered (111)-oriented films show
   the Q = 0 phase previously observed in bulk materials, but the Q = X
   phase giving the plateau state remains elusive. We conclude that the
   spin-ice physics in thin films is modified by defects and strain,
   leading to a reduction in the temperature at which correlations drive
   the system into the spin-ice state.},

Abstract = {The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a well known and handy tool to
   characterize ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic materials. Many of
   the MOKE techniques employ effects solely linear in magnetization M.
   Nevertheless, a higher-order term being proportional to M-2 and called
   quadratic MOKE (QMOKE) can additionally contribute to the experimental
   data. Here, we present detailed QMOKE spectroscopy measurements in the
   range of 0.8-5.5 eV based on a modified eight-directional method applied
   on ferromagnetic bcc Fe thin films grown on MgO substrates. From the
   measured QMOKE spectra, two further complex spectra of the QMOKE
   parameters G(s) and 2G(44) are yielded. The difference between those two
   parameters, known as Delta G, denotes the strength of the QMOKE
   anisotropy. Those QMOKE parameters give rise to the QMOKE tensor G,
   fully describing the perturbation of the permittivity tensor in the
   second order in M for cubic crystal structures. We further present
   experimental measurements of ellipsometry and linear MOKE spectra,
   wherefrom permittivity in the zeroth and the first order in M are
   obtained, respectively. Finally, all those spectra are described by ab
   initio calculations.},

Abstract = {Magnetic topological insulators (TIs) are an ideal playground for the
   study of novel quantum phenomena building on time-reversal
   symmetry-broken topological surface states. By combining different
   magnetic TIs in a heterostructure, their magnetic and electronic
   properties can be precisely tuned. Recently, we have combined
   high-moment Dy:Bi2Te3 with high transition temperature Cr: Sb2Te3 in a
   superlattice, and we found, using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
   (XMCD), that long-range magnetic order can be introduced in the
   Dy:Bi2Te3 layers. Accompanying first-principles calculations indicated
   that the origin of the long-range magnetic order is a strong
   antiferromagnetic coupling between Dy and Cr magnetic moments at the
   interface extending over several layers. However, based on XMCD alone,
   which is either averaging over the entire thin-film stack or is
   surface-sensitive, this coupling scenario could not be fully confirmed.
   Here we use polarized neutron reflectometry, which is ideally suited for
   the detailed study of superlattices, to retrieve the magnetization in a
   layer- and interface-resolved way. We find that the magnetization is, in
   contrast to similar recent studies, homogeneous throughout the
   individual layers, with no apparent interfacial effects. This finding
   demonstrates that heterostructure engineering is a powerful way of
   controlling the magnetic properties of entire layers, with the effects
   of coupling reaching beyond the interface region.},

   structures in magnetic thin film multilayers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Number = {29},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {We investigate the magnetic domain structures and the perpendicular
   magnetic anisotropy (PMA) arising in CoFeB films interfaced with
   selected heavy metal (HM) layers with large spin Hall angles in
   HM/CoFeB/MgO (HM = W, Pt, Pd, WxTa1-x) stacks as a function of CoFeB
   thickness and composition for both as-deposited and annealed materials
   stacks. The coercivity and the anisotropy fields of annealed material
   stacks are higher than for the as-deposited stacks due to
   crystallisation of the ferromagnetic layer. Generally a critical
   thickness of MgO > 1 nm provides adequate oxide formation at the top
   interface as a requirement for the generation of PMA. We demonstrate
   that in stacks with Pt as the HM, the PMA depends crucially on the alloy
   composition of the ferromagnet requiring a Co rich alloy to achieve PMA,
   i.e. it is important to have a large number of Pt-Co hybrid bonds at the
   interface compared to Pt-Fe hybrid bonds. In Pd/CoFeB/MgO layers, we
   observe for appropriate PMA a special stripe domain configuration that
   also includes circular skyrmion-like spin structures. Three different
   means of selective tuning of the PMA are discussed apart from the
   conventional FM thickness variation: Changing the number of repetitions
   of a multilayer stack is shown to change the PMA and strong PMA is found
   for certain compositions of WxTa1-x that also result in very low
   coercive fields (<1 mT) of the CoFeB. The PMA has also been shown to be
   tuned via annealing, very strong anisotropy fields of up to 1 T and low
   pinning of domain structures were measured in W/CoFeB/MgO, making these
   multilayers stacks a promising candidate for MRAM development.},

Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {115},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {In ferromagnet/heavy metal heterostructures, critical current density
   (J(C)) refers to the minimum current density required to generate
   spin-orbit torque (SOT) for effective magnetization manipulation,
   including switching of magnetization and moving of domain walls and
   magnetic skyrmions. This critical current density is a key factor for
   next-generation SOT-based magnetic random access memory, racetrack
   memory, and logic devices. In this work, the critical current density
   for magnetization switching and the thermal stability of Pt/Co/Ta
   heterostructures in response to ion irradiation are studied. It is found
   that ion irradiation represents a promising approach for the wide tuning
   of the magnetic properties, such as the coercive force and the
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy constant. It is also found that J(C)
   is significantly reduced after 500eV Ar+ irradiation. Meanwhile, the
   ratio between the thermal stability factor E/k(B)T and J(C) increases
   with an increase in the irradiation dose, although E/k(B)T decreases
   slightly with the irradiation dose. This work demonstrates that J(C) can
   be significantly reduced by an appropriate ion irradiation process and
   thereby demonstrates a promising approach for effective reduction of the
   power consumption in SOT-based spintronic devices.},

   with compositions in the ranges 30-85 at.\% Co, 12-63 at.\% Fe, and 4-8

   stabilized at Zr contents above 6 at.\%. All samples display a
   growth-induced in-plane uniaxial anisotropy, which is closely related to
   the Zr concentration gradients across the wafers. A model for the
   angular dependence of the reduced remanence, including a Gaussian
   distribution of easy/hard anisotropy axes, is presented and successfully
   used to fit the data for all samples. The magnetic moments of the
   polycrystalline films approximately follow the Slater-Pauling curve, and
   the magnetic moments of the amorphous films follow a similar trend, but

Abstract = {Laterally structured materials can exhibit properties uniquely suited

Abstract = {Nanolayer stacks are technologically very relevant for current and
   future applications in many fields of research. A nondestructive
   characterization of such systems is often performed using x-ray
   reflectometry (XRR). For complex stacks of multiple layers, low electron
   density contrast materials, or very thin layers without any pronounced
   angular minima, this requires a full modeling of the XRR data. As such a
   modeling is using the thicknesses, the densities, and the roughnesses of
   each layer as parameters, this approach quickly results in a large
   number of free parameters. In consequence, cross correlation effects or
   interparameter dependencies can falsify the modeling results. Here, the
   authors present a route for validation of such modeling results which is
   based on the reference-free grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF)
   methodology. In conjunction with the radiometrically calibrated
   instrumentation of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, the method
   allows for reference-free quantification of the elemental mass
   depositions. In addition, a modeling approach of reference-free
   GIXRF-XRR data is presented, which takes advantage of the quantifiable
   elemental mass depositions by distributing them depth dependently. This
   approach allows for a reduction of the free model parameters. Both the
   validation capabilities and the combined reference-free GIXRF-XRR
   modeling are demonstrated using several nanoscale layer stacks

   HfO 2 and
   Al 2

Abstract = {Sophisticated IrO2(110)-based model electrodes are prepared by

   on a structure-directing RuO2(110)/Ru(0001) template, exposing a regular

   together with the dedicated in situ synchrotron based techniques (SXRD,
   XRR) and ex situ characterization techniques (SEM, ToF-SIMS, XPS), the
   corrosion process of IrO2(110) in an acidic environment (pH 0.4) is
   studied on different length scales. Potential-induced pitting corrosion
   starts at 1.48 V vs SHE and is initiated at so-called surface grain
   boundaries, where three rotational domains of IrO2(110) meet. The most
   surprising result is, however, that even when the electrode potential is
   increased to 1.94 V vs SHE 60-70\% of the IrO2 film still stays intact
   down to the mesoscale and atomic scale and no uniform thinning of the
   IrO2(110) layer is encountered. Neither flat IrO2(110) terraces nor
   single steps are attacked. Ultrathin single crystalline IrO2(110) layers
   seem to be much more stable to anodic corrosion than hitherto expected.},

Abstract = {The double magnetic proximity effect (MPE) in an Fe/Fe0.30V0.70
   superlattice is studied by a direct measurement of the magnetization
   profile using polarized neutron reflectivity. The experimental
   magnetization profile is shown to qualitatively agree with a profile
   calculated using density functional theory. The profile is divided into
   a short range interfacial part and a long range tail. The interfacial
   part is explained by charge transfer and induced magnetization, while
   the tail is attributed to the inhomogeneous nature of the FeV alloy. The
   long range tail in the magnetization persists up to 170\% above the
   intrinsic ordering temperature of the FeV alloy. The observed effects
   can be used to design systems with a direct exchange coupling between
   layers over long distances through a network of connected atoms. When
   combined with the recent advances in tuning and switching, the MPE with
   electric fields and currents, the results can be applied in spintronic
   devices. Published under license by AIP Publishing.},

Title = {Structural and magnetic properties of stoichiometric Co4N epitaxial thin
   films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Number = {21},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {In this work, we measured N self-diffusion in the Co-N system and found
   an unexpected result that N diffuses out almost completely around 500 K,
   leaving behind fcc Co irrespective of the amount of N used to deposit
   Co-N. On the other hand, in previous attempts the Co4N phase has always
   been grown at 550 K or above. In view of our finding, it appears that
   fcc Co could have been mistaken for Co4N, probably due to the closeness
   of their lattice parameters (LP; fcc Co = 3.54 angstrom, Co4N = 3.74
   angstrom). Therefore, Co4N - an interesting material for its high
   spin-polarization ratio and high magnetic moment remained unexplored. By
   bringing down the growth temperature, we report the growth of
   stoichiometric Co4N epitaxial thin films. Films were grown using a
   direct current reactive magnetron sputtering process on LaAlO3 (LAO
   mismatch 1.4\%) and MgO (mismatch 11.3\%) substrates and their
   structural and magnetic properties were studied. Precise magnetic moment
   (Ms) of Co4N samples were measured using polarized neutron reflectivity
   and compared with bulk magnetization results. We found that the Ms of
   Co4N is higher due to a magnetovolume effect. Unlike previous findings,
   we observed that substrates induce misfit strain and strain
   inhomogeneity is the cause of modifications in magnetic ensemble such as
   coercivity, saturation magnetization, and magnetic anisotropy. A
   consequence of incoherent strain present in our samples is also
   reflected in the magnetic anisotropy leading to a superposition of
   strong fourfold and a small fraction of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy.
   Obtained results are presented and discussed in this work.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {The availability of native substrates is a cornerstone in the
   development of microelectronic technologies relying on epitaxial films.
   If native substrates are not available, virtual substrates - crystalline
   buffer layers epitaxially grown on a structurally dissimilar substrate -
   offer a solution. Realizing commercially viable virtual substrates
   requires the growth of high-quality films at high growth rates for
   large-scale production. We report the stoichiometric growth of SrTiO3
   exceeding 600 nm hr(-1). This tenfold increase in growth rate compared
   to SrTiO3 grown on silicon by conventional methods is enabled by a
   self-regulated growth window accessible in hybrid molecular beam
   epitaxy. Overcoming the materials integration challenge for complex
   oxides on silicon using virtual substrates opens a path to develop new
   electronic devices in the More than Moore era and silicon integrated
   quantum computation hardware.},

Abstract = {At crystalline interfaces where a valence-mismatch exists, electronic,
   and structural interactions may occur to relieve the polar mismatch,
   leading to the stabilization of non-bulk-like phases. We show that
   spontaneous reconstructions at polar La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 interfaces are
   correlated with suppressed ferromagnetism for film thicknesses on the
   order of a unit cell. We investigate the structural and magnetic
   properties of valence-matched La0.7Sr0.3CrO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 interfaces
   using a combination of high-resolution electron microscopy, first
   principles theory, synchrotron X-ray scattering and magnetic
   spectroscopy and temperature-dependent magnetometry. A combination of an
   antiferromagnetic coupling between the La0.7Sr0.3CrO3 and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3
   layers and a suppression of interfacial polar distortions are found to
   result in robust long-range ferromagnetic ordering for ultrathin
   La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. These results underscore the critical importance of
   interfacial structural and magnetic interactions in the design of

Abstract = {Here we report on the spontaneous assembly of Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes into
   monolayer films at the liquid-air interface. According to X-ray
   reflectivity and grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence both the structure
   of the layers and assembly kinetics depends on the pH value of the

   thick layer carrying a negative charge, while in the acidic medium the
   layer contains coordinated anions with the formation of the
   Br-aq(-)/Ti3C2Tx/subphase interface. The surface layer compression
   allows the assembling of MXene flakes into a dense monolayer films with
   the surface coverage of up to 96\% and surface pressure exceeding 40 mN
   m(-1) in the case of the acidic subphase. The films can readily be
   transferred onto solid substrates by the conventional Langmuir-Blodgett
   approach or modified by surfactants to form MXene/surfactant composite

Abstract = {Here we study the magnetic proximity effect in amorphous layered magnets
   of alternating high- and low-T-c materials using magnetometry and

   high-or low-T-c layer we are able to extract the induced magnetic moment
   in the low-T-c layer directly and study how it scales with thickness. We
   observe that the ordering temperature of the low-T-c layer is enhanced
   and above which a second magnetically ordered state with a very large
   extension is observed. This induced magnetic state survives to a
   temperature at least three times that of the ordering temperature of the
   low-T-c layer and the induced magnetization is approximately constant
   throughout at least a 10-nm-thick layer. The induced magnetic region
   within the low-T-c layer does not depend on the thickness of the
   adjacent high-T-c layer.},

Abstract = {The instantaneous kinetics of oxide formation and growth, in competition
   with passive film dissolution and breakdown, were investigated for Ni-22
   Cr and Ni-22 Cr-6 Mo (wt\%) during single step passivation at +0.2
   V-SCE. Experiments were conducted in selected acidic and alkaline
   chloride-containing environments using simultaneous AC and DC
   electrochemistry; including on-line Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass
   Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In parallel experiments, in-situ neutron
   reflectometry (NR) and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   were utilized to characterize the formation of surface oxide films as a
   function of time. The specific roles of pH and Mo during passivation and
   breakdown kinetics are highlighted, providing an insight into the fate
   of the elements which comprise the alloys, and their effects on
   passivation behavior. It was observed that early oxidation of both Ni
   and Cr-species occurred in acidic electrolyte. Preferential dissolution
   of Ni2+ at later times enabled gradual Cr3+ enrichment within the
   surface film. However, greater relative stability of NiO and Ni(OH)(2)
   was observed in the alkaline condition. Upon alloying Ni-Cr with Mo,
   Cr3+ became increasingly enriched in the surface film during anodic
   polarization. Oxides were interpreted to consist of non-stoichiometric
   solid solutions formed via solute capture. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

Abstract = {In the bulk, LaCoO3 (LCO) is a paramagnet, yet the low-temperature
   ferromagnetism (FM) is observed in tensile strained thin films, and its
   origin remains unresolved. Here, we quantitatively measured the
   distribution of atomic density and magnetization in LCO films by
   polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) and found that the LCO layers near
   the heterointerfaces exhibit a reduced magnetization but an enhanced
   atomic density, whereas the film's interior (i.e., its film bulk) shows
   the opposite trend. We attribute the nonuniformity to the symmetry
   mismatch at the interface, which induces a structural distortion related
   to the ferroelasticity of LCO. This assertion is tested by systematic
   application of hydrostatic pressure during the PNR experiments. The
   magnetization can be controlled at a rate of -20.4\% per GPa. These
   results provide unique insights into mechanisms driving FM in strained
   LCO films while offering a tantalizing observation that tunable
   deformation of the CoO6 octahedra in combination with the ferroelastic

   over a range of applied potentials using neutron reflectometry supported

   situ observation of the adsorbed protein across a range of applied

   layer at the metal/electrolyte interface and a further thicker but
   highly diffuse layer that could be removed by rinsing. The overall
   amount adsorbed was found to be strongly dependent on the applied
   potential and buffer pH. Subtle but significant changes in the structure
   of the adsorbed protein layer were seen as the potential was swept
   between +/- 0.40 V, reflecting changing attractive/repulsive
   interactions between the protein's charged side groups and the surface.
   At greater applied potentials, irreversible changes in the stainless

Abstract = {In a Weyl orbit, the Fermi arc surface states on opposite surfaces of
   the topological semimetal are connected through the bulk Weyl or Dirac
   nodes. Having a real-space component, these orbits accumulate a
   sample-size-dependent phase. Following recent work on the
   three-dimensional Dirac semimetal cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2), we have
   sought evidence for this thickness-dependent effect in quantum
   oscillations and quantum Hall plateaus in (112)-oriented Cd3As2 thin
   films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We compare quantum transport in
   films of varying thicknesses at apparently identical gate-tuned carrier
   concentrations and find no clear dependence of the relative phase of the
   quantum oscillations on the sample thickness. We show that small
   variations in carrier densities, difficult to detect in low-field Hall
   measurements, lead to shifts in quantum oscillations that are
   commensurate with previously reported phase shifts. Future claims of
   Weyl orbits based on the thickness dependence of quantum transport data
   require additional studies that demonstrate that these competing effects
   have been disentangled.},

Abstract = {Uranium mononitride, UN, is considered a potential accident tolerant

Abstract = {The electron-catalyzed dissolution and reprecipitation of iron
   (oxyhydr)oxides constitute critical steps in natural geochemical iron
   cycling. However, the atomic-scale mechanisms of reductive dissolution
   and oxidative precipitation of Fe2+ remain poorly understood because
   they are difficult to directly experimentally probe. Using in situ
   synchrotron X-ray scattering and a novel electrochemical cell, we
   interrogate the interfacial structure between the hematite (alpha-Fe2O3)
   (1 (1) over bar 02) surface and acidic aqueous solution (5 mM Na2SO4, pH
   4.0) under controlled electrochemical potential from the open circuit
   condition to cathodic bias as the reductive dissolution potential is
   approached and then exceeded. The crystalline order of the surface
   improves under mild reducing conditions, and the surface Fe
   stoichiometry changes with cathodic bias. After significant reductive
   dissolution occurs and cathodic bias is removed, dissolved Fe is
   redeposited, forming a disordered interface. Unlike at circumneutral pH,
   water layers at the hematite interface with acidic solution are poorly
   ordered, likely due to the adsorption of sulfate from the electrolyte.
   These results provide a novel atomic-scale view into the behavior of
   reducible transition metal oxide surfaces under fluctuating
   (electro)chemical conditions.},

Abstract = {Crystallization from an amorphous precursor presents a new route to
   control the properties of complex oxides by selecting their nanoscale
   morphology. A key challenge in crystal growth from the amorphous form is
   to select the locations of nucleation and the crystallographic
   orientation of the resulting crystals. Nucleation sites for
   crystallization of the prototypical perovskite complex oxide SrTiO3
   (STO) from its amorphous form can be reproducibly introduced using
   nanoscale seed crystals. The results of two seeding strategies are
   reported here: (i) SrRuO3 (SRO) (001)-oriented nanomembranes and (ii)
   STO nanocrystalline seeds. Amorphous STO crystallizes laterally over
   distances of several microns from the seeds before encountering
   separately nucleated crystals. The lateral crystallization rates for
   both types of seeding methods are close to the values measured in
   solidphase epitaxy (SPE) of STO on single-crystal substrates. The
   lateral crystallization distances along different crystallographic
   orientations are equal, indicating that the lateral crystallization rate
   is isotropic. The isotropic crystallization suggests that the
   rate-limiting steps for crystallization occur within the amorphous STO
   away from the amorphous/crystalline interface. In addition to the
   lateral crystallization, STO crystallizes on top of the planar SRO
   nanomembrane seeds via SPE, forming partially relaxed {[}001]-oriented
   heteroepitaxial STO layers. The in-plane orientation of laterally
   crystallized STO near the SRO nanomembrane seeds exhibits overall
   polycrystallinity with regions in which micron-scale grains of laterally
   crystallized STO share the same in-plane orientation as the SRO
   nanomembrane seeds. Crystallization from seed crystals provides
   opportunities to create a wide range of other perovskite oxides in
   nanoscale geometries.},

Abstract = {In this work, we present the first example of the self-assembly of
   phospholipid monolayers at the interface between air and an ionic
   solvent. Deep eutectic solvents are a novel class of environmentally
   friendly, non-aqueous, room temperature liquids with tunable properties,
   that have wide-ranging potential applications and are capable of
   promoting the self-assembly of surfactant molecules. We use a
   chemically-consistent Bayesian modelling of X-ray and neutron
   reflectometry measurements to show that these monolayers broadly behave
   as they do on water. This method allows for the monolayer structure to
   be determined, alongside the molecular volumes of the individual
   monolayer components, without the need for water-specific constraints to
   be introduced. Furthermore, using this method we are able to better
   understand the correlations present between parameters in the analytical
   model. This example of a non-aqueous phospholipid monolayer has
   important implications for the potential uses of these solvents and for
   our understanding of how biomolecules behave in the absence of water.},

Title = {Towards a coherent database of thermal boundary conductance at
   metal/dielectric interfaces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {125},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {The thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of metal/dielectric couples was
   measured for a large variety of metals on silicon, sapphire, and diamond
   using time domain thermoreflectance and compared to data previously
   obtained on diamond. In the case of silicon, HF-cleaned and RF-etched
   surfaces were tested. The detailed structure of these interfaces was
   studied, allowing distinction of two different cases of M/Si couples:
   (i) some amount of interfacial reaction exists for both surface
   terminations, resulting in similar TBCs; and (ii) chemically abrupt
   interfaces are achieved, resulting in TBC values that are always lower
   for RF-etched samples. The TBC values obtained on different substrates
   allowed identifying a tendency of the TBC to scale with the maximum
   transmission limit. A possible influence of the substrate was evaluated
   using both the diffuse mismatch model (DMM), which predicts a strong
   dependence on the substrate properties, and a newly developed approach
   based on the metal irradiance (IM), which predicts no dependence on the
   substrate properties. The DMM was implemented using a Debye model with
   either a linear (DMMLinear) or a Sine-Type (DMMSineType) dispersion,
   while the IM was implemented using a Sine-Type (IMSineType) dispersion.
   The DMMLinear and the IMSineType were found to be more suitable than the
   DMMSineType and to be equally precise in predicting TBC at metal/silicon
   and metal/sapphire interfaces. The IMSineType is found to be better
   suited than both the DMMLinear and the DMMSineType to predict TBC at
   metal/diamond interfaces. IMSineType being the only model tested that is
   suitable for all three substrates, it appears to be the most appropriate
   choice. As a corollary, we find that the TBC dependence on substrate
   properties is much weaker than predicted by the DMM.},

Abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that have been observed
   in bulk magnets and magnetic multilayers. For bulk magnetic materials,
   their noncollinear spin profiles have often been studied by using
   Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We experimentally
   utilized Lorentz TEM imaging to study an inversion asymmetric
   {[}Pt(1.5nm)/Co(1 nm)/W(1 nm)](8) heterostructure that exhibits
   Neel-type skyrmions at zero field. By tracking the evolution of skyrmion
   diameters as a function of magnetic fields, we determined the strength
   of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Our results
   suggest that in situ Lorentz TEM imaging combined with simulations can
   provide valuable quantitative information about the interfacial DMI
   strengths, which can be helpful for optimizing skyrmion materials.
   Furthermore, we show that in theory, Lorentz TEM can identify the spin
   chirality of Neel-type skyrmions, although an experimental verification
   is challenging due to the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio.},

Journal = {APL MATERIALS},

Abstract = {The alkaline earth stannate BaSnO3 is a semiconductor with high carrier
   mobility at room-temperature when doped with La3+. When a thin epitaxial
   layer of LaInO3 is grown on lightly doped BaSnO3, a polar discontinuity
   between the orthorhombic, polar LaInO3 and the cubic, nonpolar
   Ba0.998La0.002SnO3 leads to an electronic reconstruction, where LaInO3
   remotely dopes Ba0.998La0.002SnO3, creating carriers for high mobility
   devices. We determine aspects of the crystalline structure of the
   LaInO3/BaSnO3 film that affect the polar discontinuity using synchrotron
   x-ray diffraction. Specifically, we examine the role of oxygen
   octahedral rotations and anti-parallel cation displacements in
   influencing the polarization of the LaInO3/BaSnO3 interface. These
   structural distortions are characterized by measuring half-order Bragg
   peaks of thin film LaInO3/BaSnO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures grown by pulsed
   laser deposition. We find that for films as thin as 3 unit cells,
   epitaxial LaInO3 has 2 distinct domains, one with the same Glazer tilt
   pattern as that of bulk LaInO3, a(+)b(-)b(-), and a second rotated 90
   in-plane from the first and having tilt pattern b a(+)b Additionally, we
   observe a sudden and large increase in cation displacements along the
   {[}011] and {[}101] directions across the LaInO3/BaSnO3 interface due to
   the strength of the octahedral rotations. (C) 2019 Author(s).},

Abstract = {Single layer Mo and Si thin films deposited for different deposition

   measurements. Subsequently, few Mo/Si multilayers having 5 bi-layers
   with different Mo to bi-layer thickness ratio (Gamma) at a fixed
   bi-layer thickness have been deposited and characterized by GIXRR
   measurements. Investigation has been carried out on the different
   behaviors of the interfaces and also variation of the interface width
   with Gamma has been studied. Finally, 25 bi-layer Mo/Si multilayer
   samples having the lowest Gamma value and with and without carbon
   diffusion barrier layer at both the Mo/Si interfaces are deposited and
   the interfaces have been characterized by hard X-ray and soft X-ray
   reflectivity measurements. The study shows improvement in reflectivities
   of the multilayer with carbon diffusion barrier layer from 38\% to 54\%
   at 130 angstrom wavelength. To have further insight into the
   modification of the interface due to introduction of the carbon barrier
   layer, depth selective study of both the multilayers have been carried
   out by Grazing Incidence Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure
   measurements using synchrotron radiation and thereby investigating the
   local structures around Mo atoms in Si bulk region and Si-on-Mo

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the impact of using III-nitride semiconductors

   NbTiN deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering. The resulting NbTiN
   layers are (111)-oriented, fully relaxed, and they keep an epitaxial
   relation with the substrate. The higher critical superconducting
   temperature (T-c = 11.8 K) was obtained on AIN-on-sapphire, which was
   the substrate with smaller lattice mismatch with NbTiN. We attribute
   this improvement to a reduction of the NbTiN roughness, which appears
   associated with the relaxation of the lattice misfit with the substrate.
   On AlN-on-sapphire, superconducting nanowire single photon detectors
   were fabricated and tested, obtaining external quantum efficiencies that
   are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations.},

Abstract = {We have developed an improved method of time-resolved x-ray reflectivity
   (XRR) using monochromatic synchrotron radiation. Our method utilizes a
   polycapillary x-ray optic to create a range of incident angles and an
   area detector to collect specular reflections. By rotating the sample
   normal out of the plane of the incident fan, we can separate the surface
   diffuse scatter from the reflectivity signal, greatly improving the
   quality of the XRR spectra compared to previous implementations. We
   demonstrate the time-resolved capabilities of this system, with the
   temporal resolution as low as 10 ms, by measuring XRR during the
   annealing of Al/Ni nano-scale multilayers, and use this information to
   extract the activation energy for interdiffusion in this system.

Abstract = {With in situ surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and X-ray reflectivity
   (XRR) in combination with ex situ characterization by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic
   voltammetry, the electrochemical reduction of an ultrathin (1.66 nm
   thick) single-crystalline RuO2(110) layer supported on Ru(0001) is
   studied in an acidic environment, providing clear-cut evidence and
   mechanistic details for the transformation of RuO2 to hydrous RuO2 and
   metallic Ru. The reduction process proceeds via proton insertion into
   the RuO2(110) lattice. For electrode potentials (0 to -50 mV vs standard
   hydrogen electrode), the layer spacing of RuO2(110) increased,
   maintaining the octahedral coordination of Ru (SXRD). Continuous proton
   insertion at -100 to -150 mV leads to the transformation of the lattice
   oxygen of RuO2 to OH and water, which destroys the connectivity among
   the Ru-O-6 octahedrons and eventually leads to the loss of crystallinity
   (SXRD) in the RuO2(110) film at -200 mV accompanied by a swelling of the
   layer with a well-defined thickness (XRR). During the protonation
   process, soluble Ru complexes may form. With XPS the transformation of
   RuO2(110) to a hydrous RuO2 layer is followed, a process that proceeds
   first homogeneously and at higher cathodic potentials heterogeneously by
   re-deposition of previously electrochemically dissolved Ru complexes.},

Abstract = {A 166-nm-thick amorphous Niobium pentoxide layer (Nb2O5) on a silicon

   domain thermoreflectance measurements, thermal transients with a time
   resolution in (sub-)nanoseconds can be obtained by a pump-probe laser
   technique. The analysis of the thermal transient was carried out via the
   established analytical approach, but also by a numerical approach. The
   analytical approach showed a thermal diffusivity and thermal
   conductivity from 0.43 mm(2)/s to 0.74 mm(2)/s and from 1.0 W/mK to 2.3
   W/mK, respectively to temperature. The used numerical approach was the
   structure function approach to map the measured heat path in terms of a
   RthCth-network. The structure function showed a decrease of R-th with
   increasing temperature according to the increasing thermal conductivity
   of Nb2O5. The combination of both approaches contributes to an in-depth

Abstract = {Data-driven materials discovery has become increasingly important in
   identifying materials that exhibit specific, desirable properties from a
   vast chemical search space. Synergic prediction and experimental
   validation are needed to accelerate scientific advances related to
   critical societal applications. A design-to-device study that uses
   high-throughput screens with algorithmic encodings of structure-property
   relationships is reported to identify new materials with panchromatic
   optical absorption, whose photovoltaic device applications are then
   experimentally verified. The data-mining methods source 9431 dye
   candidates, which are auto-generated from the literature using a custom
   text-mining tool. These candidates are sifted via a data-mining workflow
   that is tailored to identify optimal combinations of organic dyes that
   have complementary optical absorption properties such that they can
   harvest all available sunlight when acting as co-sensitizers for
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Six promising dye combinations are
   shortlisted for device testing, whereupon one dye combination yields
   co-sensitized DSSCs with power conversion efficiencies comparable to
   those of the high-performance, organometallic dye, N719. These results
   demonstrate how data-driven molecular engineering can accelerate
   materials discovery for panchromatic photovoltaic or other applications.},

Abstract = {refnx is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis
   package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on
   Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based,
   through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being
   composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the
   interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters
   (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model
   and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the
   residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system.
   Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets
   and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as
   probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the
   system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of
   components, over and above those available from the parameters alone.
   Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The software offers a
   choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and
   gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain
   Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the
   model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining
   parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting
   scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to
   facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and
   subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information,
   permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.},

Abstract = {In this work, silicon-doped indium oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs)
   have been fabricated for the first time by a solution processing method.
   By varying the Si concentration in the In2O3-SiO2 binary oxide structure
   up to 15 at\%, the thicknesses, densities, and crystallinity of the
   resulting In Si-O (ISO) thin films were investigated by x-ray
   reflectivity (XRR) and x-ray diffraction techniques, while the produced
   TFTs were characterized by a conventional three-probe method. The
   results of XRR analysis revealed that the increase in the content of Si
   dopant increased the thickness of the produced film and reduced its
   density, and that all the Si-doped ISO thin films contained only a
   single amorphous phase even after annealing at temperatures as high as
   800 degrees C. The manufactured ISO TFTs exhibited a reduction in the
   absolute value of threshold voltage V-T close to 0 V and low current in
   the off-state, as compared to those of the non-doped indium oxide films,
   due to the reduced number of oxygen defects, which was consistent with
   the behavior of ISO TFTs fabricated by a sputtering method. The ISO TFT
   with a Si content of 3 at\% annealed at 400 degrees C demonstrated the
   smallest subthreshold swing of 0.5 V/dec, V-T of -5 V, mobility of 0.21
   cm(2) Vs(-1,) and on/off current ratio of about 2 x 10(7).},

   h-LSCO coercivity within the LSCO serve to independently affect the

Abstract = {We report on the significant enhancement of perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy of Ni/NiO multilayers after mild annealing up to 90 min at
   250 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy shows that after
   annealing, a partial crystallization of the initially amorphous NiO
   layers occurs. This turns out to be the source of the anisotropy
   enhancement. Magnetic measurements reveal that even multilayers with Ni
   layers as thick as 7 nm, which in the as-deposited state showed in-plane
   anisotropy with square hysteresis loops, show reduced in-plane remanence
   after thermal treatment. Hysteresis loops recorded with the field in the
   normal-to-film-plane direction provide evidence for perpendicular
   magnetic anisotropy with up and down magnetic domains at remanence. A
   plot of effective uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constant times individual
   Ni layer thickness as a function of individual Ni layer thickness shows
   a large change in the slope of the data attributed to a drastic change
   of volume anisotropy. Surface anisotropy showed a small decrease because
   of some layer roughening introduced by annealing.},

Abstract = {The Ti15Mo alloy has been studied towards long-term corrosion
   performance in saline solution at 37 degrees C using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. The physical and chemical characterization of
   the material were also investigated. The as-received Ti15Mo alloy
   exhibits a single beta-phase structure. The thickness of single-layer
   structured oxide presented on its surface is similar to 4 nm. Impedance
   measurements revealed that the Ti15Mo alloy is characterized by
   spontaneous passivation in the solution containing chloride ions and
   formation of a double-layer structured oxide composed of a dense
   interlayer being the barrier layer against corrosion and porous outer
   layer. The thickness of this oxide layer, estimated based on the
   impedance data increases up to similar to 6 nm during 78 days of
   exposure. The observed fall in value of the log vertical bar Z vertical
   bar(f) (=) (0.01) (Hz) indicates a decrease in pitting corrosion
   resistance of Ti15Mo alloy in saline solution along with the immersion
   time. The detailed EIS study on the kinetics and mechanism of corrosion
   process and the capacitive behavior of the Ti15Mo electrode vertical bar
   passive layer vertical bar saline solution system was based on the
   concept of equivalent electrical circuit with respect to the physical
   meaning of the applied circuit elements. Potentiodynamic studies up to 9
   V vs. SCE and SEM analysis show no presence of pitting corrosion what
   indicates that the Ti15Mo alloy is promising biomaterial to long-term
   medical applications.},

   disappears for x = 43. The results are consistent with the two-grain
   Stoner-Wohlfarth model. It is argued that the collapse of the hard axes
   can be controlled by intergranular exchange interaction. Quadratic
   magneto-optical Kerr effect (QMOKE) is also observed in the films and is
   found to weaken if the in-plane anisotropy is lowered through the Co:Pd
   ratio. QMOKE is observed for magnetic field orientations near the hard
   axes but not exactly along it, in agreement with the two-grain
   Stoner-Wohlfarth model.},

Abstract = {Interfacial charge and strain distributions inside artificial perovskite
   ABO(3) heterostructures often affect intriguing physical properties that
   are important to device performance. Normally, both charge and strain
   coexist across the interfaces, and their exact roles in determining the
   properties remain elusive. In the present work, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)
   ultrathin films were grown on (001)-0.7Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) O-3-0.3PbTiO(3)
   (PMNPT) single-crystal substrates to discriminate between the effect of
   charge and strain on the transport and magnetoelectric properties. In
   heterostructures with thicker LSMO films, the strain effect dominates
   the resistance and the magnetic moment depends on the external electric
   field. With the decreasing LSMO thickness, the butterfly-like
   resistance-electric-field (R-E) and magnetization-electric-field (M-E)
   curves become loop-like, indicating that charge effects dominate strain
   effects in determining the electric field that controls the transport
   and magnetic properties. Furthermore, soft-x-ray absorption spectra of
   32 and 4 nm LSMO/PMNPT samples at the Mn L edge under an applied
   electric field of +/- 6 kV/cm indicate that orbital reconstruction also
   plays an important role in interfacial magnetoelectric coupling.

Abstract = {Water at the interface and in the bulk of ultrathin ionomer films

   This is the first study wherein the water distribution and the

   the composition and length of sulfonic group terminating side chains, as
   confined thin films (similar to 15 nm) on a Pt surface are examined by
   neutron reflectometry, ellipsometry, and quartz crystal microbalance.
   For the shorter side-chain perfluorosulfonated acid (PFSA) ionomers,
   Nafion EW 1100 and 3M EW 725, one to two monolayers equivalent of
   interfacial water, similar to adsorbed water on bare Pt, under wet
   conditions (97\% humidity) was observed. In contrast, for the longer
   chain perfluoroimide acid (PFIA) ionomer, five monolayers equivalent of
   interfacial water was observed. In the bulk phase of the films, the PFIA
   ionomer exhibited a multilamellar structure comprising a water-rich
   layer near the interface region whereas the PFSA ionomer had a more
   uniform distribution of water. Our study for the first time demonstrates

Title = {Magnetic properties and field-driven dynamics of chiral domain walls in
   epitaxial Pt/Co/AuxPt1-x trilayers},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {98},
Number = {21},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Chiral domain walls in ultrathin perpendicularly magnetized layers have
   a Ned structure stabilized by a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
   that is generated at the interface between the ferromagnet and a heavy
   metal. Different interface materials or properties are required above
   and below a ferromagnetic film in order to generate the structural
   inversion asymmetry needed to ensure that the DMI arising at the two
   interfaces does not cancel. Here we report on the magnetic properties of
   epitaxial Pt/Co/AuxPt1-x, trilayers grown by sputtering onto sapphire
   substrates with 0.6 nm thick Co. As x rises from 0 to 1, a structural
   inversion asymmetry is progressively generated. We characterize the
   epilayer structure with x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional
   transmission electron microscopy, revealing (111) stacking. The
   saturation magnetization falls as the proximity magnetization in Pt is
   reduced, whilst the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy K-u rises. The
   micromagnetic DMI strength D was determined using the bubble expansion
   technique and also rises from a negligible value when x = 0 to similar
   to 1 mJ/m(2) for x = 1. The depinning field at which field-driven domain
   wall motion crosses from the creep to the depinning regime rises from
   similar to 40 to similar to 70 mT, attributed to greater spatial
   fluctuations of the domain wall energy with increasing Au concentration.
   Meanwhile, the increase in DMI causes the Walker field to rise from
   similar to 10 to similar to 280 mT, meaning that only in the x = 1
   sample is the steady flow regime accessible. The full dependence of
   domain wall velocity on driving field bears little resemblance to the
   prediction of a simple one-dimensional model, but can be described very
   well using micromagnetic simulations with a realistic model of disorder.
   These reveal a rise in Gilbert damping as x increases.},

Title = {Three-dimensional atomic scale electron density reconstruction of
   octahedral tilt epitaxy in functional perovskites},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Octahedral tilts are the most ubiquitous distortions in
   perovskite-related structures that can dramatically influence
   ferroelectric, magnetic, and electronic properties; yet the paradigm of
   tilt epitaxy in thin films is barely explored. Non-destructively
   characterizing such epitaxy in three-dimensions for low symmetry complex
   tilt systems composed of light anions is a formidable challenge. Here we
   demonstrate that the interfacial tilt epitaxy can transform ultrathin
   calcium titanate, a non-polar earth-abundant mineral, into
   high-temperature polar oxides that last above 900 K. The comprehensive
   picture of octahedral tilts and polar distortions is revealed by
   reconstructing the three-dimensional electron density maps across
   film-substrate interfaces with atomic resolution using coherent Bragg
   rod analysis. The results are complemented with aberration-corrected
   transmission electron microscopy,film superstructure reflections, and
   are in excellent agreement with density functional theory. The study
   could serve as a broader template for non-destructive, three-dimensional
   atomic resolution probing of complex low symmetry functional interfaces.},

Abstract = {Nondiffusive phonon thermal transport, extensively observed in
   nanostructures, has largely been attributed to classical size effects,
   ignoring the wave nature of phonons. We report localization behavior in
   phonon heat conduction due to multiple scattering and interference
   events of broadband phonons, by measuring the thermal conductivities of
   GaAs/AlAs superlattices with ErAs nanodots randomly distributed at the
   interfaces. With an increasing number of superlattice periods, the
   measured thermal conductivities near room temperature increased and
   eventually saturated, indicating a transition from ballistic to
   diffusive transport. In contrast, at cryogenic temperatures the thermal
   conductivities first increased but then decreased, signaling phonon wave
   localization, as supported by atomistic Green's function simulations.
   The discovery of phonon localization suggests a new path forward for
   engineering phonon thermal transport.},

Abstract = {Oxygen ion exchanges at the surface of transition metal oxides have been
   extensively studied for understanding their nanoscale ionic behavior as
   well as for realizing multifunctionalities such as exotic magnetism,
   insulator-to-metal transition, band gap tuning, etc. To activate this
   exchange behavior, in many cases extreme conditions such as high
   temperature, high electric fields, and high vacuum are often required.
   These conditions have blocked the promising materials from being applied
   on real devices such as solid-oxide fuel cells and other electrochemical
   devices. In this article, we show that redox-driven reversible
   topotactic transformation in epitaxial SrFe0.8Co0.2O3-x thin films can
   be achieved at low temperature and at atmospheric pressure. This
   transformation triggers changes in electronic structures as well. These
   reversible redox reactions and/or associated changes at low temperature
   and under atomospheric pressure are particularly needed to develop a
   cathode for low solid-oxide fuel cells.},

Title = {Influence of chemical composition and crystallographic orientation on

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {The emergence of magnetism unique to the interface between the
   multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) and ferromagnetic La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) offers
   an opportunity to control magnetism in nanoscale heterostructures with
   electric fields. In this paper, we investigate the influence of chemical
   composition and crystallographic orientation on the interfacial
   magnetism of BFO/LSMO superlattices. Our results reveal that the induced
   net magnetic moment in the BFO layers increases monotonically with
   increasing saturation magnetization of the LSMO layers. For the
   (100)-BFO/LSMO (x = 0.2) superlattice, the induced moment reaches a
   record high value of similar to 2.8 mu(B)/Fe. No interfacial
   magnetization is observed at the (100)-BFO/LSMO interface when LSMO is
   an antiferromagnet. In contrast to (100)-oriented superlattices, no
   induced moment is observed in (111)-BFO layers. Our results suggest the
   interfacial structural reconstruction may not be a sufficient condition
   for the enhanced net moment in BFO layer. Instead, spin canting induced

Abstract = {The interfacial structure of SrZrxTi1-xO3 films grown on semiconducting
   Ge substrates is investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and
   first-principles density functional theory. By systematically tuning the
   Zr content x, the effects of bonding at the interface and epitaxial
   strain on the physical structure of the film can be distinguished. The
   interfacial perovskite layers are found to be polarized as a result of
   cation-anion ionic displacements perpendicular to the
   perovskite/semiconductor interface. We find a correlation between the
   observed buckling and valence band offsets at the SrZr(x)Ti(1-)xO(3)/Ge
   interface. The trends in the theoretical valence band offsets as a
   function of Zr content for the polar structures are in agreement with
   reported X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. These results
   have important implications for the integration of functional oxide
   materials with established semiconductor based technologies. Published

Abstract = {The thin film phase behavior of ternary blends consisting of symmetric
   poly(styrene) (PS)-b-poly(dimethylsiloxane)(PDMS), PS, and PDMS was
   investigated using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). This system is strongly segregated, and the homopolymers are
   approximately the same length as the corresponding blocks of the
   copolymer. The XRR and AFM data are used to quantify changes in domain
   spacing (L) and morphology evolution with increasing homopolymer content
   (phi(H)). In 100 nm thick films, from phi(H) = 0 to 0.20, the system
   maintains a perfect parallel lamellar structure and domains swell as
   predicted based on theory; however, from phi(H) = 0.30 to 0.50, a
   morphology transition to a ``dot pattern{''} morphology (tentatively
   identified as perforated lamellae) and mixed morphologies were observed
   before macrophase separation. In thicker films, dot patterns were
   observed for a broad range of phi(H) before macrophase separation. The
   absence of the bicontinuous microemulsion phase reported for bulk blends
   and thin films of perpendicular lamellae and the presence of dot
   patterns/perforated lamellae are attributed to preferential migration of
   the PDMS homopolymer to the wetting layers located at the substrate and
   free air interfaces, which leads to an asymmetric composition within the
   film and morphology transition. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Abstract = {The properties of many materials can be strongly affected by the atomic
   valence of the contained individual elements, which may vary at surfaces
   and other interfaces. These variations can have a critical impact on
   material performance in applications. A non-destructive method for the
   determination of layer-by-layer atomic valence as a function of material
   thickness is presented for La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films. The method
   utilizes a combination of bulk- and surface-sensitive X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy (XAS) detection modes; here, the modes are fluorescence
   yield and surface-sensitive total electron yield. The weighted-average
   Mn atomic valence as measured from the two modes are simultaneously
   fitted using a model for the layer-by-layer variation of valence based
   on theoretical model Hamiltonian calculations. Using this model, the Mn
   valence profile in LSMO thin film is extracted and the valence within
   each layer is determined to within an uncertainty of a few percent. The
   approach presented here could be used to study the layer-dependent
   valence in other systems or extended to different properties of
   materials such as magnetism.},

Abstract = {Pulsed laser deposition has been used to prepare thin films of the high
   entropy alloy AlCrFeCoNiCu. The 35 nm films were deposited in ultra-high
   vacuum onto glass at room temperature and above and analysed using X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Films deposited at
   room temperature exhibit a mix of FCC and BCC reflections, the FCC
   crystallites having size similar to the film thickness, but the BCC
   crystallites are larger. The intensity of the reflections from both
   crystal structures reduce with increasing deposition temperature, the
   fall in BCC commencing at lower temperature than the FCC associated with
   a reduction of the content of Al and Cu. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy shows that the films deposited at room temperature are
   closer to stoichiometry than those at higher temperatures. An important
   feature of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiles is
   surface segregation, the outer 3 nm of the high entropy alloy films has
   higher concentration of Al and, to a lesser extent, Cr.},

   a migrant element in the YIG/GGG system. We further correlate the
   presence of a Ga-rich transition layer with considerable quenching of
   ferromagnetic resonance and spin wave propagation in thin YIG films.
   Finally, we clarify the origin of the enigmatic low-density overlayer
   that is often observed in neutron and x-ray reflectometry studies of the

Abstract = {We report on the electrical properties of polycrystalline NbO2 thin film

   self-sustained current oscillatory behavior of films with different

   in the insulating state was dominated by the trap-charge assisted
   Poole-Frankel conduction mechanism. All films showed threshold switching
   behavior in agreement with the previously proposed Joule heating

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Number = {10},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {The influence of the thickness of a thin (1.5-30 nm) copper layer on the
   thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at the interface between gold and
   silicon, sapphire and diamond, respectively, was studied using Time
   Domain Thermoreflectance. Overall, a monotonic increase in the TBC was
   observed over the first 10 nm, before reaching a plateau. In some cases,
   it was also observed that an interlayer reduces the TBC as compared to
   the reference system. This is rationalized by assuming that the TBC
   evolution as a function of the interlayer thickness is controlled by (i)
   a contribution of the gold layer that has to be taken into account for
   all phonons having a wavelength larger than the interlayer thickness and
   (ii) a thickness-dependent resistance within the interlayer that appears
   when the electron-phonon coupling is incomplete, i.e., typically over
   the first 10 nm. A model is proposed in which the contribution to
   thermal boundary conductance by phonons coming directly from the gold
   layer is estimated using a simple Debye approximation, while the
   resistance that appears within the interlayer is estimated by g(T) times
   h with g(T) the electron-phonon coupling factor and h the interlayer
   thickness. This results in a system with three resistances in series,
   i.e., the metal-metal and metal-dielectric interfacial resistances and
   the interlayer resistance, and a contribution due to phonons of the gold
   layer. A reasonably good agreement between this model and experimental
   data is observed. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {Precise integration of pi-conjugated units is a key issue to achieve
   molecular (nano) electronic devices based on organic semiconductor
   materials. We specifically examine the Langmuir-Blodgett technique,
   which allows high-density integration of pi-conjugated units. In this
   study, we designed a carbazole containing acrylamide-based homopolymer
   {[}poly(9-ethyl-3-carbazolyl acrylamide) (pCzAA)], in which the
   pi-conjugated unit is connected with a hydrophilic amide unit directly
   as a side chain. Its Langmuir-Blodgett film formation properties were
   investigated. The pCzAA polymer took a stable monolayer formation in the
   presence of a small amount (ca. 10 mol \%) of poly(N-dodecylacrylamide)
   (pDDA). Compared with amphiphilic carbazole-containing copolymers
   described in earlier reports, the direct connection of pi-conjugated
   units through amide bonding enables the Cz content in monolayers to
   exceed that of the copolymer monolayers (ca. 30 mol \%) dramatically.
   pCzAA:pDDA takes highly ordered layer structures toward the out-of-plane
   direction, although no structural order is formed in the in-plane
   direction. This method is a practical means to develop low-dimensional
   and high-density integration of ir-conjugated units for molecular
   electronics.},

Abstract = {Crystal truncation rod (CTR) measurements and density functional theory
   (DFT) calculations were performed to determine the atomic structure of
   the mineral-water interface of the \{100\} surface of xenotime
   (nominally YPO4). This mineral is important, because it incorporates a
   variety of rare earth elements (REEs) in its crystal structure. REEs are
   critical materials necessary for a variety of renewable and energy
   efficient technologies. Current beneficiation techniques are not highly
   selective for REE ore minerals, and large amounts go to waste; this is a
   first step toward designing more efficient beneficiation. Evidence is
   found for minor relaxation of the surface within the topmost monolayer
   with little or no relaxation in subsurface layers. Justification for
   ordered water at the interface is found, where water binds to surface
   cations and donates hydrogen bonds to surface phosphates. The average
   bond lengths between cations and oxygens on water are 228 pm in the best
   fit to the CTR data, versus 243 and 251 pm for the DFT. No agreement on
   water positions bound to surface phosphates is obtained. Overall, the
   findings suggest that ligands used in beneficiation with a single
   anionic headgroup, such as fatty acids, will have limited selectivity
   for xenotime relative to undesirable minerals.},

Abstract = {Magneto-optic surface plasmon resonance (MOSPR)-based sensors are highly
   attractive as next-generation biosensors. However, these sensors suffer
   from oxidation leading to degradation of performance, reproducibility of
   the sensor surface, because of the difficulty of removing adsorbed
   materials, and degradation of the sensor surface during surface cleaning
   and these limit their applications. In this paper, I propose MOSPR-based
   biosensors with 0 to 15 nm thick inert polycarbonate laminate plastic as
   a protective layer and theoretically demonstrate the practicability of
   my approach in water-medium for three different probing samples:
   ethanol, propanol, and pentanol. I also investigate microstructure and
   magnetic properties. The chemical composition and layered information of
   the sensor are investigated using X-ray reflectivity and X-ray
   diffraction analyses and these show distinct face-centered-cubic
   (fcc)-Au (111) phases, as dominated by the higher density of conduction
   electrons in Au as compared to Co. The magnetic characterization
   measured with the in-plane magnetic field to the sensor surface for both
   the as-deposited and annealed multilayers showed isotropic easy axis
   magnetization parallel to the multilayer interface at a saturating

Abstract = {Single crystal epitaxial thin films of UN and alpha-U2N3 have been grown
   for the first time by reactive DC magnetron sputtering. These films
   provide ideal samples for fundamental research into the potential
   accident tolerant fuel, UN, and U2N3 , its intermediate oxidation
   product. Films were characterised using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), with XRD analysis showing both
   thin films to be {[}001] oriented and composed of a single domain. The
   specular lattice parameters of the UN and U2N3 films were found to be
   4.895 angstrom and 10.72 angstrom, respectively, with the UN film having
   a miscut of 2.6 degrees. XPS showed significant differences in the N-1 s
   peak between the two films, with area analysis showing both films to be
   stoichiometric.},

Abstract = {In this contribution we discuss the structural, morphological and
   optical properties of ZnO thin films deposited on glass substrates by
   radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. Our results indicate
   that an increase in deposition time leads to a change in the film growth
   mechanism. Three different growth regimes can be observed when the
   deposition time changes. Islands initially start to nucleate and grow
   into rough and highly stressed films. Increasing the surface population
   leads to island coalescence compatible with a planar architecture, where
   the stress is relieved, and the roughness is minimized. Longer still
   deposition times induce the growth of columnar structures. The increase
   in deposition time brings about a stress relaxation and grain growth
   together with a reduction of the texture coefficient, c-lattice
   contraction and an increase of band gap values.},

Title = {In situ structural study of the surface complexation of lead(II) on the

Abstract = {A structural study of the surface complexation of Pb(II) on the (1 (1)
   over bar 02) surface of hematite was undertaken using crystal truncation
   rod (CTR) X-ray diffraction measurements under in situ conditions. The
   sorbed Pb was found to form inner sphere (IS) complexes at two types of
   edge-sharing sites on the half layer termination of the hematite (1 (1)
   over bar 02) surface. The best fit model contains Pb in distorted
   trigonal pyramids with an average Pb-O bond length of 2.27(4) angstrom
   and two characteristic Pb-Fe distances of 3.19(1) angstrom and 3.59(1)
   angstrom. In addition, a site coverage model was developed to simulate
   coverage as a function of sorbate-sorbate distance. The simulation
   results suggest a plausible Pb-Pb distance of 5.42 angstrom, which is
   slightly larger than the diameter of Pb's first hydration shell. This
   relates the best fit surface coverage of 0.59(4) Pb per unit cell at
   monolayer saturation to steric constraints as well as electrostatic
   repulsion imposed by the hydrated Pb complex. Based on the structural
   results we propose a stoichiometry of the surface complexation reaction
   of Pb(II) on the hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface and use bond
   valence analysis to assign the protonation schemes of surface oxygens.
   Surface reaction stoichiometry suggests that the proton release in the
   course of surface complexation occurs from the Pb-bound surface O atoms

Abstract = {Inserting an antiferromagnetic layer of NiO between Pt and Y3Fe5O12

   in Pt/YIG to a negative sign at low temperature. Here, we use polarized
   neutron reflectometry to explore the coupling between NiO and YIG to
   understand the mechanism of the negative SMR. A weak uncompensated
   magnetic moment is observed in the NiO and the direction of this moment
   is perpendicular to YIG. Therefore, we infer that the spin axis of NiO
   is perpendicular to YIG. This result directly supports the explanation
   that the negative SMR results from the pure spin current reflected back
   by the NiO layer and the spin-flop coupling between NiO and YIG.

Abstract = {Rutile RuO2 is a highly active catalyst for a number of
   (electro)chemical reactions in aqueous solutions or in humid
   environments. However, the study of the interaction of RuO2 surfaces
   with water has been confined largely to the ultrahigh vacuum environment
   and to the thermodynamically stable (110) surface. In this work, we
   combine ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ
   surface diffraction, and density functional theory calculations to
   investigate how four different facets of RuO2 interact with water under
   humid and electrochemical environments. The vacant coordinatively
   unsaturated Ru site (CUS) allows for the adsorption and dissociation of
   water molecules. Different surfaces exhibit unique binding energetics
   for -H2O and -OH and can allow for different degrees of hydrogen bonding
   between the adsorbates. Consequently, the degree of water dissociation
   is found to be sensitive to the surface crystallographic
   orientation-being maximum for the (101) surface, followed by the (110),
   (001) and (100) surfaces. This study identifies crystallographic
   orientation as an important parameter to tune not only the density of
   active sites but also the energetics for water dissociation; this
   finding is of great significance for many catalytic reactions, where
   water is a key reactant, or product.},

Title = {SiC-Doped Ge2Sb2Te5 Phase-Change Material: A Candidate for High-Density
   Embedded Memory Application},
Journal = {ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Phase-change memory is one of the most attractive solutions for embedded
   applications, thanks to the low cost of integration with current
   manufacturing processes and the good scaling behavior. Despite intensive
   research efforts that are devoted to the modification of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)
   phase-change material, the obtained improvements are still
   unsatisfactory for high-performance applications. In this paper,
   SiC-modification is first introduced to enhance the amorphous stability
   of GST without sacrificing its transition speed. Several enhancements
   can be demonstrated, including better thermal stability (10-year data
   retention above 120 degrees C), lower RESET voltage (about 3.0 V at 20
   ns pulse width), reduced volume change (smaller than 3.0\%), and
   expected operation cycles (more than 1.0 x 10(5)). According to the
   findings, the local bonding nature of Ge/Te atoms can be tuned by C/Si
   dopants through forming CGe and SiTe bonds. Apart from strengthening the
   atomic binding network for desirable data retention, the element
   interdiffusion is also effectively controlled and suppressed. Together
   with finer grains, smaller density change, and more uniform morphology,
   the modified structure transition finally contributes to the reduced
   switching voltage and long-term endurance. Hence, it is envisaged that
   SiC-doped GST with such advantages will give a competitive option for
   high-density and high-performance embedded memory.},

Abstract = {Fe65Co35 thin films have been deposited on SiO2 substrates using
   sputtering technique with different choices of seed layer; Ru,
   Ni82.5Fe17.5, Rh, Y and Zr. Best soft magnetic properties were observed
   with seed layers of Ru, Ni82.5Fe17.5 and Rh. Adding these seed layers,
   the coercivity of the Fe65Co35 films decreased to values of around 1.5
   mT, which can be compared to the value of 12.5 mT obtained for films
   deposited without seed layer. Further investigations were performed on
   samples with these three seed layers in terms of dynamic magnetic
   properties, both on as prepared and annealed samples, using constant
   frequency cavity and broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurements.
   Damping parameters of around 8.0 x 10(-3) and 4.5 x 10(-3) were obtained
   from in-plane and out-of-plane measurements, respectively, for the as
   prepared samples, values that were reduced to about 6.5 x 10(-3) and 4.0

   SrMnO3-delta F gamma oxyfluoride films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {We report the synthesis of SrMnO3-delta F gamma perovskite oxyfluoride
   thin films using a vapor transport method to fluorinate as-grown
   SrMnO2.5 epitaxial thin films. The influence of the fluoropolymer, which
   acts as a fluorine vapor source, was investigated by utilizing polyvinyl
   fluoride (PVF), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), and
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the reaction. The same process was
   carried out with polyethylene to isolate the role of carbon in the vapor
   transport process. The F distribution was probed by x-ray photoemission
   spectroscopy, which confirmed the incorporation of F into the films and
   revealed higher F concentrations in films exposed to PVF and PVDF
   compared to PTFE. The c-axis parameter expands after fluorination, a
   result consistent with density functional theory calculations that
   attribute the volume expansion to elongated Mn-F bonds compared to
   shorter Mn-O bonds. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show that
   the fluorination process reduces the nominal Mn oxidation state
   suggesting that F substitutes on O sites in the lattice as opposed to
   filling anion vacancy sites, a finding further supported by calculated
   formation energies of different F site occupancies. These results
   provide insights into topochemical fluorination of perovskite oxides,
   which should enable future synthesis and design efforts focused on
   oxyfluoride heterostructures.},

Title = {Removal of the Magnetic Dead Layer by Geometric Design},
Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {30},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {The proximity effect is used to engineer interface effects such as
   magnetoelectric coupling, exchange bias, and emergent interfacial
   magnetism. However, the presence of a magnetic dead layer adversely
   affects the functionality of a heterostructure. Here, it is shown that
   by utilizing (111) polar planes, the magnetization of a manganite
   ultrathin layer can be maintained throughout its thickness. Combining
   structural characterization, magnetometry measurements, and
   magnetization depth profiling with polarized neutron reflectometry, it
   is found that the magnetic dead layer is absent in the (111)-oriented
   manganite layers, however, it occurs in the films with other
   orientations. Quantitative analysis of local structural and elemental
   spatial evolutions using scanning transmission electron microscopy and
   electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals that atomically sharp
   interfaces with minimal chemical intermixing in the (111)-oriented
   superlattices. The polar discontinuity across the (111) interfaces
   inducing charge redistribution within the SrTiO3 layers is suggested,
   which promotes ferromagnetism throughout the (111)-oriented ultrathin
   manganite layers. The approach of eliminating problematic magnetic dead
   layers by changing the crystallographic orientation suggests a
   conceptually useful recipe to engineer the intriguing physical
   properties of oxide interfaces, especially in low dimensionality.},

Abstract = {While the SrTiO3/LaAlO3 (STO/LAO) materials system has been widely
   studied in the hopes of integrating it into transition metal oxide (TMO)
   electronic devices, recent reports have focused on its optical
   properties. Electronic confinement in STO quantum wells (QWs) and the
   optical modulation of confined charge carriers have recently been
   demonstrated, suggesting the feasibility of producing TMO-based QW
   optoelectronic devices. However, before these devices can be realized,
   it is necessary to develop the capability to grow such structures
   arbitrarily thick while maintaining high crystalline quality. We report
   on the fabrication of STO/LAO QW heterostructures and demonstrate via
   reflection high-energy electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction,
   reciprocal space mapping, and X-ray reflectivity measurements that these
   heterostructures can be grown arbitrarily thick while maintaining a high
   crystalline quality and uniform periodicity, in contrast to previous
   reports. While we focus primarily on the STO/LAO system in this report,
   we believe the growth and design principles contained herein can inform
   the growth of a multitude of different TMO QW heterostructures, paving
   the way for the next generation of TMO-based QW optoelectronic devices.

Abstract = {Amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) is an important material for
   surface defect passivation of photovoltaic silicon (Si) wafers in order
   to reduce their recombination losses. The material is, however, unstable
   with regard to hydrogen (H) desorption at elevated temperatures, which
   can be an issue during processing and device manufacturing. In this
   work, we determine the temperature stability of a-Si:H by structural
   characterization of a-Si:H/Si bilayers with neutron reflectometry and
   X-ray reflectometry combined with photoconductance measurements,
   yielding the minority carrier lifetime. The neutrons are sensitive to
   light elements such as H, while the X-rays, which are insensitive to the
   H concentration, provide an independent constraint on the layer
   structure. It is shown that H desorption takes place at a temperature of
   approximately T = 425 degrees C, and that the H content and minority
   carrier lifetimes have a strongly correlated linear relationship, which
   can be interpreted as one H atom passivating one defect.},

Abstract = {Superconducting-nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are able to
   reach near-unity detection efficiency in the infrared spectral range.
   However, due to the intrinsic asymmetry of nanowires, SNSPDs are usually
   very sensitive to the polarization of the incident radiation, their
   responsivity being maximum for light polarized parallel to the nanowire
   length (transverse-electric (TE) polarization). Here, we report on the
   reduction of the polarization sensitivity obtained by capping NbN-based
   SNSPDs with a high-index SiNx dielectric layer, which reduces the
   permittivity mismatch between the NbN wire and the surrounding area.
   Experimentally, a polarization sensitivity below 0.1 is obtained both at
   1.31 and 1.55 mu m, in excellent agreement with simulations. (C) 2018

Abstract = {A study of the interface structure of superconducting and

   The analysis has demonstrated the excellent sharpness of the
   CaCuO2/SrTiO3 interface (roughness smaller than one perovskite unit
   cell). Furthermore, we were able to discriminate between the
   superconducting and the non-superconducting phase. In the former case,
   we found an increase of the spacing between the topmost Ca plane of
   CaCuO2 block and the first TiO2 plane of the overlaying STO block,
   relative to the non-superconducting case. These results are in agreement
   with the model that foresees a strong oxygen incorporation in the
   interface Ca plane in the superconducting heterostructures.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {The metastable epsilon-Fe2O3 is known to be the most intriguing
   ferrimagnetic and multiferroic iron oxide phase exhibiting a bunch of
   exciting physical properties both below and above room temperature. The
   present paper unveils the structural and magnetic peculiarities of a few
   nm thick interface layer discovered in these films by a number of
   techniques. The polarized neutron reflectometry data suggests that the
   interface layer resembles GaFeO3 in composition and density and is
   magnetically softer than the rest of the epsilon-Fe2O3 film. While the
   in-depth density variation is in agreement with the transmission
   electron microscopy measurements, the layer-resolved magnetization
   profiles are qualitatively consistent with the unusual wasp-waist
   magnetization curves observed by superconducting quantum interference
   device magnetometry. Interestingly a noticeable Ga diffusion into the
   epsilon-Fe2O3 films has been detected by secondary ion mass spectroscopy
   providing a clue to the mechanisms guiding the nucleation of exotic
   metastable epsilon ferrite phase on GaN at high growth temperature and
   influencing the interfacial properties of the studied films.},

Title = {Helical magnetic structure and the anomalous and topological Hall
   effects in epitaxial B20 Fe1-yCoyGe films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Number = {21},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Epitaxial films of the B20-structure compound Fe1-yCoyGe were grown by
   molecular beam epitaxy on Si (111) substrates. The magnetization varied
   smoothly from the bulklike values of one Bohr magneton per Fe atom for
   FeGe to zero for nonmagnetic CoGe. The chiral lattice structure leads to
   a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the films' helical
   magnetic ground state was confirmed using polarized neutron
   reflectometry measurements. The pitch of the spin helix, measured by
   this method, varies with Co content y and diverges at y similar to 0.45.
   This indicates a zero crossing of the DMI, which we reproduced in
   calculations using first-principles methods. We also measured the
   longitudinal and Hall resistivity of our films as a function of magnetic
   field, temperature, and Co content y. The Hall resistivity is expected
   to contain contributions from the ordinary, anomalous, and topological
   Hall effects. Both the anomalous and topological Hall resistivities show
   peaks around y similar to 0.5. Our first-principles calculations show a
   peak in the topological Hall constant at this value of y, related to the
   strong spin polarization predicted for intermediate values of y. Our
   calculations predict half-metallicity for y = 0.6, consistent with the
   experimentally observed linear magnetoresistance at this composition,
   and potentially related to the other unusual transport properties for
   intermediate value of y. While it is possible to reconcile theory with
   experiment for the various Hall effects for FeGe, the large topological
   Hall resistivities for y similar to 0.5 are much larger than expected
   when the very small emergent fields associated with the divergence in
   the DMI are taken into account.},

Abstract = {The corrosive breakdown of thin iron films supported on silicon
   substrates under a number of conditions is presented-in particular to
   understand better how iron, and hence ferritic steel, behaves in a salty
   water environment. A combination of X-ray and neutron reflectometry was
   used to monitor the structures of both metal and oxide surface layers
   and also organic corrosion inhibitors adsorbed at the iron/aqueous
   interface. A range of behavior in seawater was observed, including
   complete dissolution and void formation under the metal surface.
   Importantly, two simple treatments-UV/ozone or soaking in ultrapure
   water-were found to significantly protect the iron surface for
   considerable lengths of time, although evidence of pitting corrosion
   began after around 10 days. The underlying causes of the efficacies of
   these treatments were further investigated using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. In addition, three potential corrosion inhibitors were
   investigated: (i) dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) demonstrated
   no ability to protect the surface; (ii) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
   appeared to accelerate corrosion; and (iii) bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate
   showed an impressive level of protection (the neutron reflectometry
   results indicated a thick diffuse layer of surfactant of 23\% surface
   coverage). These findings have been interpreted in terms of preferential
   inhibitor adsorption at cathodic and anodic surface sites (depending on
   the nature of the inhibitor).},

Title = {Microscopic effects of Dy doping in the topological insulator Bi2Te3},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Number = {17},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Magnetic doping with transition metal ions is the most widely used
   approach to break time-reversal symmetry in a topological insulator
   (TI)-a prerequisite for unlocking the TI's exotic potential. Recently,
   we reported the doping of Bi2Te3 thin films with rare-earth ions, which,
   owing to their large magnetic moments, promise commensurately large
   magnetic gap openings in the topological surface states. However, only
   when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in angle-resolved
   photoemission spectroscopy, which persists up to room temperature.
   Although disorder alone could be ruled out as a cause of the topological
   phase transition, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic and
   electronic properties of Dy-doped Bi2Te3 remained elusive. Here, we
   present an x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized neutron
   reflectometry, muon-spin rotation, and resonant photoemission study of
   the microscopic magnetic and electronic properties. We find that the
   films are not simply paramagnetic but that instead the observed behavior
   can be well explained by the assumption of slowly fluctuating,
   inhomogeneous, magnetic patches with increasing volume fraction as the
   temperature decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large effective
   magnetization can be easily introduced by the application of moderate
   magnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for
   proximity coupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a
   heterostructure with transition-metal-doped layers. However, the
   introduction of some charge carriers by the Dy dopants cannot be
   excluded at least in these highly doped samples. Nevertheless, we find
   that the magnetic order is not mediated via the conduction channel in
   these samples and therefore magnetic order and carrier concentration are
   expected to be independently controllable. This is not generally the
   case for transition-metal-doped topological insulators, and Dy doping
   should thus allow for improved TI quantum devices.},

Abstract = {Development of novel magnetic materials is of interest for fundamental

   element ferromagnetism, since Fe, Co, and Ni, in metastable tetragonal
   Ru, which has been predicted. Body-centered tetragonal Ru phase is
   realized by use of strain via seed layer engineering. X-ray diffraction
   and electron microscopy confirm the epitaxial mechanism to obtain
   tetragonal phase Ru. We observed a saturation magnetization of 148 and
   160 emu cm(-3) at room temperature and 10 K, respectively. Control
   samples ensure the ferromagnetism we report on is from tetragonal Ru and
   not from magnetic contamination. The effect of thickness on the magnetic
   properties is also studied, and it is observed that increasing thickness
   results in strain relaxation, and thus diluting the magnetization.
   Anomalous Hall measurements are used to confirm its ferromagnetic

   P-6,P-6,P-6,P-14]{[}BMB], has been studied at a gold electrode surface
   in a polar solvent. For a 20\% w/w IL mixture, contrast matched to the
   gold surface, distinct Kiessig fringes were observed for all potentials
   studied, indicative of a boundary layer of different composition to that
   of the bulk IL-solvent mixture. With applied potential, the amplitudes
   of the fringes from the gold-boundary layer interface varied
   systematically. These changes are attributable to the differing ratios
   of cations and anions in the boundary layer, leading to a greater or
   diminished contrast with the gold electrode, depending on the individual
   ion scattering length densities. Such electro-responsive changes were
   also evident in the reflectivities measured for the pure IL and a less
   concentrated (5\% w/w) IL-solvent mixture at the same applied
   potentials, but gave rise to less pronounced changes. These
   measurements, therefore, demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity achieved
   by contrast matching the bulk solution and that the structure of the IL
   boundary layers formed in mixtures is strongly influenced by the bulk
   concentration. Together these results represent an important step in
   characterising IL boundary layers in IL-solvent mixtures and provide
   clear evidence of electro-responsive structuring of IL ions in their

Abstract = {The binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to a 316L stainless steel
   surface from a buffer solution has been characterized using neutron
   reflectometry and quartz crystal microbalance measurements; coverage at
   all concentrations up to a near-physiological concentration was found to
   be relatively low (<20\%); the protein followed a two-step isotherm
   adsorption model type and the overall thickness at higher concentrations
   (around 80 (A) over-circle) suggested possible multilayering and/or
   protein unfolding. As it has been postulated that BSA may inhibit the
   further adsorption of another blood plasma protein-fibrinogen-the
   effects of preadsorbing BSA on fibrinogen adsorption were examined,
   first by prior physisorption of BSA to the stainless steel surface and
   second by pretreating the stainless steel with a layer of sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS) to render it more hydrophobic. Although the preadsorption
   of BSA to an untreated stainless steel surface did slightly decrease the
   amount of fibrinogen adsorbed initially, it had no inhibiting effect if
   a solution containing solely fibrinogen subsequently flowed through. In
   contrast, the SDS-treated surface yielded both an increased BSA
   adsorption and consistently decreased fibrinogen adsorption.},

Abstract = {Development of fast and energy-efficient spintronic devices requires
   novel nanoscaled materials with controllable magnetic properties. Here
   we show that the introduction of an ultrathin W interlayer between Co
   and Ru in Ru/Co/Ru films enables to preserve perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy (PMA) and dramatically reduce the coercive force and size of
   magnetic domains. We find that the Ru/Co/W/Ru films with up to 0.35 nm
   of the nominal thickness of W have robust PMA. The observed formation of
   a dendritic domain structure with small domains having homochiral Neel
   domain walls is an indicator of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
   interaction appearing in trilayers with asymmetrical interfaces. The
   inversion-symmetry-broken Ru/Co/W/Ru films are a potential host for
   nucleation and manipulation of non-trivial spin textures like chiral
   domain walls and skyrmions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Samarium hexaboride (SmB6), a Kondo insulator with mixed valence, has
   recently attracted much attention as a possible host for correlated
   topological surface states. Here, we use a combination of x-ray
   absorption and reflectometry techniques, backed up with a theoretical
   model for the resonant M-4,M-5 absorption edge of Sm and photoemission
   data, to establish laterally averaged chemical and valence depth
   profiles at the surface of SmB6. We show that upon cleaving, the highly
   polar (001) surface of SmB6 undergoes substantial chemical and valence
   reconstruction, resulting in boron termination and a Sm3+ dominated
   subsurface region. Whereas at room temperature, the reconstruction
   occurs on a timescale of less than 2 h, it takes about 24 h below 50 K.
   The boron termination is eventually established, irrespective of the
   initial termination. Our findings reconcile earlier depth resolved
   photoemission and scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies performed at
   different temperatures and are important for better control of surface
   states in this system.},

Title = {Bringing nanomagnetism to the mesoscale with artificial amorphous
   structures},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Number = {17},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {In the quest for materials with emergent or improved properties, an
   effective route is to create artificial superstructures. Novel
   properties emerge from the coupling between the phases, but the strength
   of this coupling depends on the quality of the interfaces. Atomic
   control of crystalline interfaces is notoriously complicated and to
   elude that obstacle, we suggest here an all-amorphous design. Starting
   from a model amorphous iron alloy, we locally tune the magnetic behavior
   by creating boron-doped regions by means of ion implantation through a
   lithographic mask. This process preserves the amorphous environment,
   creating a non-topographic magnetic superstructure with smooth
   interfaces and no structural discontinuities. The absence of
   inhomogeneities acting as pinning centers for the magnetization reversal
   is demonstrated by the formation of magnetic vortexes for ferromagnetic
   disks as large as 20 mu m in diameter embedded within a paramagnetic
   matrix. Rigid exchange coupling between two amorphous ferromagnetic
   phases in a microstructured sample is evidenced by an investigation
   involving first-order reversal curves. The sample consists of a soft
   matrix with embedded elements constituting a hard phase where the
   anisotropy originates from an elongated shape of the elements. We
   provide an intuitive explanation for the micrometer-range exchange
   coupling mechanism and discuss how to tailor the properties of
   all-amorphous superstructures.},

Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},

Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Metastable alpha `'-Fe16N2 has attracted much interest as a candidate
   for rare-earth-free hard magnetic materials. We demonstrate that Fe16N2
   thin films were grown epitaxially on Cr seed layers with MgO (001)
   substrates by facing-target sputtering. Good crystallinity with the
   epitaxial relation MgO (001){[}110] parallel to Cr (001){[}100] parallel
   to Fe16N2 (001){[}100] was obtained. The chemical order parameter, which
   quantifies the degree of N ordering in the Fe16N2 (the N-disordered
   phase is alpha'-Fe8N martensite), reaches 0.75 for Cr-seeded samples. Cr
   has a perfect lattice constant match with Fe16N2, and no noticeable
   strain can be assigned to Fe16N2. The intrinsic saturation magnetization
   of this non-strained Fe16N2 thin film at room temperature is determined
   to be 2.31 T by polarized neutron reflectometry and confirmed with

Abstract = {Magneto-optical surface plasmon resonance (MOSPR) sensors benefit from a

   (SPR) sensors, making these devices attractive for biosensing

   multilayers can yield sizeable MOSPR improvements in spite of the
   relative high total Co layer thickness. Co(t(Co))/Au(2 nm) multilayers,
   with 1.2 <= t(Co) <= 1.8 nm are prepared and characterized. X-ray
   analysis shows that the microstructure maintains high layer periodicity
   and improves upon annealing. The multilayer structures were then modeled
   to study their SPR/MOSPR sensitivities, suggesting that the MOSPR
   sensitivity is enhanced by a factor of up to 3 and 4 with respect to the
   SPR sensitivity when the devices are operated in Air and Water media,
   respectively. We find that multilayers provide a particular advantage
   when operating the sensors in Water-based media.},

Abstract = {Divalent tin is of great interest, but comes with a drawback-its
   metastable nature. In pursuing divalent tin, the authors systematically
   examine the change in oxidation states of Sn using a set of ALD SnOx
   films annealed in different atmospheres at temperatures ranging from 350
   to 650 degrees C. Although the majority of Sn in the film was
   tetravalent after deposition, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray
   absorption near-edge structure verified the presence of divalent Sn
   after annealing in H-2, and the divalent Sn content increased as the
   annealing temperature was raised. The local structures of Sn processed
   under these conditions were probed using extended x-ray absorption fine
   structure. Data from samples annealed in H-2 at 350, 450, and 550
   degrees C were fitted well using a rutile SnO2 model; the sample
   annealed in H-2 at 650 degrees C could only be fitted using a hybrid of
   SnO2 and SnO models. Annealing in N-2 and O-2 resulted in tetravalent
   Sn. X-ray reflectivity showed that the density of the as-deposited film
   was as low as 50\% of that for bulk SnO2; annealing in H-2 first
   increased the critical angle, but the lowest density was found in films
   annealed in H-2 at 650 degrees C. Scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy analysis revealed that the as-deposited films were amorphous
   whereas the annealed films underwent a dewetting process after annealing
   for 30 min in H-2 at 550 degrees C; the resulting structure was
   separated into tin-rich spheres with oxygen-rich outer shells and SnO
   clusters, possibly due to the lattice mismatch between Sn and SnO after
   disproportionation. Published by the AVS.},

Abstract = {The multilayer structure of Fe/Si and Fe/Ge systems fabricated by ion
   beam sputtering (IBS) was investigated using X-ray and polarized neutron
   reflectivity measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy
   with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The obtained result revealed that
   the incorporation of sputtering gas particles (Ar) in the Ge layer gives
   rise to a marked reduction in the neutron scattering length density
   (SLD) and contributes to the SLD contrast between the Fe and Ge layers
   almost vanishing for spin-down neutrons. Bundesmann et al. (2015) have
   shown that the implantation of primary Ar ions backscattered at the
   target is responsible for the incorporation of Ar particles and that the
   fraction increases with increasing ion incidence angle and increasing
   polar emission angle. This leads to a possibility of fine-tuning of the
   SLD for the IBS, which is required to realize a high polarization
   efficiency of a neutron polarizing supermirror. Fe/Ge polarizing
   supermirror with m = 5 fabricated under the same condition showed a
   spin-up reflectivity of 0.70 at the critical momentum transfer. The
   polarization was higher than 0.985 for the q(2). range where the
   correction for the polarization inefficiencies of the beamline works
   properly. The result of the polarized neutron reflectivity measurement
   suggests that the ``magnetically-dead'' layers formed at both sides of
   the Fe layer, together with the SLD contrast, play a critical role in
   determining the polarization performance of a polarizing supermirror.

   imide substituents, branched alkyl chains -C8H16 and linear fluoroalkyl
   chains -C4F7H2, respectively. Both types of substituents introduce some
   degree of steric hindrance for intermolecular interactions, affecting
   solid-state packing during thin film formation, and thus induce specific
   structure-dependent optoelectronic properties in thin films. The
   transition from an amorphous structure to crystalline domains with
   strong intermolecular coupling was followed in situ and in real time
   during growth. We investigated the structural and morphological
   properties by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy as a
   function of the substrate temperature and chemical structure. We
   examined the relationship between the structural properties and thin
   film optical signatures probed via differential reflectance
   spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and temperature-dependent photoluminescence.
   A new crystalline PDIR-CN2 polymorph at high temperatures emerges. In

Abstract = {The delicate interplay of competing phases in quantum materials is
   dominated by parameters such as the crystal field potential, the
   spin-orbit coupling, and, in particular, the electronic correlation
   strength. Whereas small quantitative variations of the parameter values
   can thus qualitatively change the material, these values can hitherto
   hardly be obtained with reasonable precision, be it theoretically or
   experimentally. Here we propose a solution combining resonant x-ray
   reflectivity (RXR) with multiplet ligand field theory (MLFT). We first
   perform ab initio DFT calculations within the MLFT framework to get
   initial parameter values, which we then use in a fit of the theoretical
   model to RXR. To validate our method, we apply it to NiO and SrTiO3 and
   obtain parameter values, which are amended by as much as 20\% compared
   to the ab initio results. Our approach is particularly useful to
   investigate topologically trivial and nontrivial correlated insulators,
   staggered moments in magnetically or orbitally ordered materials, and

Abstract = {Deliberate control of oxygen vacancy formation and migration in
   perovskite oxide thin films is important for developing novel electronic
   and iontronic devices. Here, it is found that the concentration of
   oxygen vacancies (V-O) formed in LaNiO3 (LNO) during pulsed laser
   deposition is strongly affected by the chemical potential mismatch
   between the LNO film and its proximal layers. Increasing the V-O
   concentration in LNO significantly modifies the degree of orbital
   polarization and drives the metal-insulator transition. Changes in the
   nickel oxidization state and carrier concentration in the films are
   confirmed by soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and optical
   spectroscopy. The ability to unidirectional-control the oxygen flow
   across the heterointerface, e.g., a so-called oxygen diode, by
   exploiting chemical potential mismatch at interfaces provides a new
   avenue to tune the physical and electrochemical properties of complex
   oxides.},

Title = {Spin Solid versus Magnetic Charge Ordered State in Artificial Honeycomb
   Lattice of Connected Elements},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The nature of magnetic correlation at low temperature in two-dimensional
   artificial magnetic honeycomb lattice is a strongly debated issue. While
   theoretical researches suggest that the system will develop a novel zero
   entropy spin solid state as T -> 0 K, a confirmation to this effect in
   artificial honeycomb lattice of connected elements is lacking. This
   study reports on the investigation of magnetic correlation in newly
   designed artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice of ultrasmall elements,
   with a typical length of approximate to 12 nm, using neutron scattering
   measurements and temperature-dependent micromagnetic simulations.
   Numerical modeling of the polarized neutron reflectometry data
   elucidates the temperature-dependent evolution of spin correlation in
   this system. As temperature reduces to approximate to 7 K, the system
   tends to develop novel spin solid state, manifested by the alternating
   distribution of magnetic vortex loops of opposite chiralities.
   Experimental results are complemented by temperature-dependent
   micromagnetic simulations that confirm the dominance of spin solid state
   over local magnetic charge ordered state in the artificial honeycomb
   lattice with connected elements. These results enable a direct
   investigation of novel spin solid correlation in the connected honeycomb
   geometry of 2D artificial structure.},

Abstract = {Nickel carbon based multi-layers are a viable route towards future hard

   layers with surface roughnesses (RMS) of <= 0.2 nm. Small droplets
   resulting during melting of the targets surface increase the roughness,
   however, and cannot be avoided. The sequential process at temperatures
   beyond 300 degrees C results into intermixing between the two layers,
   being destructive for the reflectivity of the multi-layer. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The authors report the effects of growth temperature on the

   (La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O-3 at temperatures between 700 and 950
   degrees C. Calcium was supplied by a standard thermal effusion cell,
   while the metalorganic precursor titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP) was
   used as the titanium source. The stoichiometric growth conditions were
   mapped using a combination of x-ray diffraction, reflection high energy
   electron diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. It is found that the
   growth window widened and shifted to higher TTIP fluxes with increasing
   temperature. Further, the shift of the growth window edge to Ti-rich
   conditions is three times larger than the growth window edge to Ca-rich
   conditions, which is discussed in general terms of the kinetic processes
   involved in hMBE.},

Abstract = {Thin Co films intercalated between a Graphene capping layer and the
   Ir(111) surface are of interest for spintronics applications due to
   their peculiar magnetic properties and to their chemical stability. The
   structure, and then the magnetic properties, of the Co films depend on
   the intercalation process which is strongly influenced by the
   temperature, total amount of Cobalt and quality of the capping Graphene
   layer. In order to identify and disentangle the effects of these
   contributions, we report on the structural characterisation of four Co
   films as a function of thickness, annealing temperature, and Graphene
   capping. From the structural point of view, the deposition of Co on a
   hot Ir substrate mimics quite well the intercalation process proving the
   validity of the colander model describing the Graphene role during the
   process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Potential-Specific Structure at the Hematite-Electrolyte Interface},
Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {8},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {The atomic-scale structure of the interface between a transition metal
   oxide and aqueous electrolyte regulates the interfacial chemical
   reactions fundamental to (photo)electrochemical energy conversion and
   electrode degradation. Measurements that probe oxide-electrolyte
   interfaces in situ provide important details of ion and solvent
   arrangements, but atomically precise structural models do not exist for
   common oxide-electrolyte interfaces far from equilibrium. Using a novel
   cell, the structure of the hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) (1 (1) over bar
   02)-electrolyte interface is measured under controlled electrochemical
   bias using synchrotron crystal truncation rod X-ray scattering. At
   increasingly cathodic potentials, charge-compensating protonation of
   surface oxygen groups increases the coverage of specifically bound water
   while adjacent water layers displace outwardly and became disordered.
   Returning to open circuit potential leaves the surface in a persistent
   metastable state. Therefore, the flux of current and ions across the
   interface is regulated by multiple electrolyte layers whose specific
   structure and polarization change in response to the applied potential.
   The study reveals the complex environment underlying the simplified
   electrical double layer models used to interpret electrochemical
   measurements and emphasizes the importance of condition-specific
   structural characterization for properly understanding catalytic
   processes at functional transition metal oxide-electrolyte interfaces.},

Abstract = {Current-voltage hysteresis is a major issue for normal architecture
   organo-halide perovskite solar cells. In this manuscript we reveal a
   several-angstrom thick methylammonium iodide-rich interface between the
   perovskite and the metal oxide. Surface functionalization via
   :self-assembled monolayers allowed us to control the composition.of the
   interface monolayer from Pb poor to Pb rich, which, in parallel,
   suppresses hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. The bulk of the
   perovskite films is not affected by the interface engineering and
   remains \_highly- crystalline in the surface normal direction over the
   whole film thickness. The subnanometer structural modifications of the
   buried interface were revealed by X-ray reflectivity, which is most
   sensitive to monitor changes in the mass density of only
   several-angstrom thin interfacial layers as a function of substrate
   functionalization. From Kelvin probe force microscopy study on a solar
   cell cross section, we further demonstrate local variations of the
   potential on different electroriAransporting layers within a solar cell.
   Ori-the basis of these findings, we present a unifying model explaining
   hysteresis in perovskite solar cells, giving an insight into,one crucial

Abstract = {The reversible topotactic phase transformation between brownmillerite
   SrCoO2.5 to perovskite SrCoO3 has attracted more and more attention for
   potential applications as solid oxide fuels and electrolysis cells.
   However, the relatively easy transformation result from small thermal
   stable energy barriers between the two phases leads to unstable the
   structures. In the paper, amounts of SrCoO3-delta films have been
   prepared by pulsed laser deposition at optimized growth conditions with
   the temperature range of 590-720 degrees C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   results demonstrated that a phase competition emerged around 650 degrees
   C. The Gibbs free energies of two phases at high temperature revealed
   the difference of stability of these two phases under different growth
   temperature. The optical spectroscopies and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopies were used to verify the electronic structure and chemical
   state differences between the two phases with distinct crystal

Abstract = {Using polarized neutron reflectometry, we measured the influence of

   contrast to that of (La1-xPrx)(1-y),Ca-y,MnO3 (LPCMO) films for which
   strain of +/- 0.01\% produced dramatic changes in the magnetization
   profile and Curie temperature. We attribute the difference between the
   influence of strain on the saturation magnetization in LSMO (weak or
   none) and LPCMO (strong) to a difference in the ability of LSMO (weak or
   none) and LPCMO (strong) to phase separate. Our observation provides an

Abstract = {Sputter deposited symmetric multilayers of (n Fe)/(n Ni), with
   individual thicknesses from n = 4 to n = 48 monolayers (ML), were
   deposited on epitaxial Cu/Si(001), and their microstructural evolution
   and magnetic properties versus n have been studied. Elemental layering
   can be seen with transmission electron microscopy down to n = 4 ML layer
   thickness, although an intermixed region characterized by a finite
   interface width is found to be present. This width is composed of the
   interface roughness as well as the interdiffusion between layers, but
   the relative contributions from these two sources could not be concluded
   by the techniques used. The measured elemental layering and X-ray
   reflectivity (XRR) give an upper limit to the interface width which must
   be smaller than the thinnest layers, 4 ML. Electron energy loss
   spectroscopy (EELS), depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and also XRR reveal that Fe has a higher tendency to mix with Ni
   than vice versa. XPS does not have the resolution to measure this thin
   elemental layering: composition variations for n = 8 ML which are
   clearly seen by EELS are barely resolved by XPS. The structure was
   determined by X-ray diffraction, and an epitaxial fcc (001) structure is
   found to be maintained throughout the multilayers up to n less than or
   similar to 8 ML. For larger n values, relaxation starts by Fe-fcc(001)
   layers changing into Fe-bcc(110), which is then followed by Ni-fcc(001)
   changing from (001) to (111) orientation along the growth direction. A
   decreased total measured magnetic moment for the fully epitaxial
   multilayers can be explained by the fcc Fe layers being partly
   anti-ferromagnetic, whereas the relaxed multilayers exhibit the expected
   magnetic properties of (bcc Fe) +(fcc Ni).},

Abstract = {The chemically ordered B2 phase of equiatomic FeRh is known to absorb or
   evolve a significant latent heat as it traverses its first-order phase
   transition in response to thermal, magnetic, and mechanical drivers.
   This attribute makes FeRh an ideal magnetocaloric material testbed for
   investigation of relationships between the crystalline lattice and the
   magnetic spins, which are especially experimentally accessible in thin
   films. In this work, epitaxial FeRh films of nominal 30 nm and 50 nm
   thicknesses with out-of-plane c-axis orientation were sputter-deposited
   at high temperature onto (001)-MgO or (0001)-Al2O3 substrates and capped
   with Al, Au, Cr, or W after in situ annealing at 973 K to promote
   CsCl-type chemical order. In this manner a controlled strain state was
   invoked. Experimental results derived from laboratory and synchrotron
   x-ray diffraction combined with magnetometry indicate that the
   antiferromagnetic (AF)-ferromagnetic (FM) magnetostructural phase
   transformation in these films may be tuned over an similar to 50 degrees
   range (373 K-425 K) through variation in the c/a ratio derived from
   lattice strain delivered by the substrate and the capping layers. These
   results supply fundamental information that might be used to engineer
   the magnetocaloric working material in new system designs by introducing
   targeted values of passive strain to the system.},

Abstract = {The time domain thermal reflectance (TDTR) method enables thermal
   investigations of films in the nanometre range, which can be found in
   microelectronic devices. In this study, a 166 nm thick Diniobium
   pentoxide layer (Nb2O5), which is used in capacitors, optical devices as
   well as precursors, was investigated by using TDTR method. This layer
   was studied by its thermal transients in the (sub-)nanosecond time range
   at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 500 degrees C.
   In this paper, these thermal transients of the Nb2O5 layer were analysed
   by three evaluation approaches: One analytical and two numerical
   approaches, the relative thermal resistance method and the structure
   function method. The analytical approach revealed that its thermal
   diffusivity and thermal conductivity increases with rising temperature
   from (0.43 to 0.74) mm(2)/s and from (1.0 to 2.3) W/mK. The numerical
   approaches enables to get rid of certain up-front assumptions, which are
   necessary when applying analytical solution and enables deeper
   understanding of the Nb2O5 thermal behaviour.},

Abstract = {The heterointerfacing of different materials with competing magnetic
   orders forms the basis for today's spintronic devices, however materials
   compatibility has remained a major limitation to the conception of new
   multilayered systems. Here, we uncover a multilayer of competing
   magnetic orders within a single layer of FeRh after low-energy He-ion
   irradiation: metamagnetic, ferromagnetic, and spin glass. Polarized
   neutron reflectometry, irradiation modeling, and density functional
   theory calculations reveal a direct correlation between the disorder
   concentration, the depth-dependent magnetic ordering, and the onset of
   the metamagnetic transition. Such a heterostructure opens the door to
   new paradigms in antiferromagnetic electronics and ultra-low-power
   magnetization controllability.

   structural quality of the films and flat and atomically sharp interfaces
   of the superlattices. The STEM data also reveal a difference in the
   interfacial layer stacking with a SrO layer at the LCMO/SFO and a LaO
   layer at the SFO/LCMO interfaces along the PLD growth direction. The
   x-ray diffraction (XRD) data suggest that the as grown SFO films and
   SFO/LCMO superlattices have an oxygen-deficient SrFeO3-delta structure
   with I4/mmm space group symmetry (delta <= 0.2). Subsequent ozone
   annealed SFO films are consistent with an almost oxygen stoichiometric
   structure (delta approximate to 0). The electronic and magnetic
   properties of these SFO films are similar to the ones of corresponding
   single crystals. In particular, the as grown SrFeO3-delta films are
   insulating whereas the ozone annealed films are metallic. The
   magneto-resistance effects of the as grown SFO films have a similar
   magnitude as in the single crystals, but extend over a much wider
   temperature range. Last but not least, for the SFO/LCMO superlattices we
   observe a rather large exchange bias effect that varies as a function of
   the cooling field.},

Abstract = {We have developed a method to grow and characterize the state of the art
   non-polar ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O multi-quantum wells on m-plane ZnO substrates as
   a prerequisite for applications based on intersub-band transitions. The
   epilayer interfaces exhibit a low roughness, and the layer thickness
   remains constant within one monolayer in these heterostructures. The
   optical properties have been studied in the UV and IR domains by means
   of photoluminescence and absorption experiments, respectively. In the
   UV, the photoluminescence is very well described by an excitonic
   transition, with the clear effect of quantum confinement as a function
   of the well thickness in the absence of the internal field. In the IR,
   the intersubband transitions can be precisely modeled if a large
   depolarization shift is taken into account. Overall, we demonstrate a
   very good control in the design and fabrication of ZnO quantum wells
   (QWs) for intersubband transitions. Our result gives a clear
   understanding of the ISBTs in ZnO QWs. (C) 2017 Author(s).},

Abstract = {While the surface atomic structure of RuO2 has been well studied in
   ultra high vacuum, much less is known about the interaction between
   water and RuO2 in aqueous solution. In this work, in situ surface X-ray
   scattering measurements combined with density functional theory (DFT)
   were used to determine the surface structural changes on single-crystal
   RuO2(110) as a function of potential in acidic electrolyte. The redox
   peaks at 0.7, 1.1 and 1.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
   could be attributed to surface transitions associated with the
   successive deprotonation of -H2O on the coordinatively unsaturated Ru
   sites (CUS) and hydrogen adsorbed to the bridging oxygen sites. At
   potentials relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an -OO
   species on the Ru CUS sites was detected, which was stabilized by a
   neighboring -OH group on the Ru CUS or bridge site. Combining
   potential-dependent surface structures with their energetics from DFT
   led to a new OER pathway, where the deprotonation of the -OH group used
   to stabilize -OO was found to be rate-limiting.},

Abstract = {Integration of emerging complex-oxide compounds into sophisticated

   from the kinetics of vapor phase thin-film epitaxial growth. A
   comparison of the crystallization of the model perovskite SrTiO3 (STO)
   on (001) STO and oxidized (001) Si substrates indicates that there is a
   viable alternative route that can yield three-dimensional epitaxial
   synthesis, an approach in which STO is crystallized from an amorphous
   thin film by postdeposition annealing. The crystallization of amorphous
   STO on single crystal (001) STO substrates occurs via solid-phase
   epitaxy (SPE), without nucleation and with a temperature-dependent
   amorphous/crystalline interface velocity. In comparison, the
   crystallization of STO on SiO2/(001) Si substrates nucleation, resulting
   in a polycrystalline film with crystal sizes on the order of 10 nm. A
   comparison of the temperature dependence of the nucleation and growth
   processes for these two substrates indicates that it will be possible to
   create crystalline STO materials using low-temperature crystallization
   from a crystalline seed, even in the presence of interfaces with other
   materials. These processes provide a potential route for the formation
   of single crystals with intricate three-dimensional nanoscale

   glass-like thermal transitions in sufficiently aged glassy polystyrene
   films. We find that favorable interaction between the solid substrate
   and the polymer film induces stratification within the film resulting in
   different densities across the film thickness. Existence of two
   glass-like thermal transitions (one at 70 degrees C and the other at 95
   degrees C) is independently confirmed by temperature dependent
   spectroscopic ellipsometry and Raman spectroscopy measurements.
   Interestingly, the thermal coefficient of expansion of the polymer film
   displays anomalous behavior with temperature and is found to have the
   lowest value over the temperature range 70-95 degrees C, i.e. between

Abstract = {Uranium oxide is central to every stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, from
   mining through fuel fabrication and use, to waste disposal and
   environmental cleanup. Its chemical and mechanical stability are
   intricately linked to the concentration of interstitial O atoms within
   the structure and the oxidation state of U. We have previously shown
   that, during corrosion of the UO2 (111) surface under either 1 atm of
   O-2 gas or oxygenated water at room temperature, oxygen interstitials
   diffuse into the substrate to form a superlattice with three-layer
   periodicity. In the current study, we present results from surface X-ray
   scattering that reveal the structure of the oxygen diffusion profile
   beneath the (001) surface. The first few layers below the surface
   oscillate strongly in their surface -normal lattice parameters,
   suggesting preferential interstitial occupation of every other layer
   below the surface, which is geometrically consistent with the
   interstitial network that forms below the oxidized (111) surface. Deeper
   layers are heavily contracted and indicate that the oxidation front
   penetrates similar to 52 angstrom below the (001) surface after 21 days
   of dry O-2 gas exposure at ambient pressure and temperature. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy indicates U is present as U(IV), U(V), and
   U(VI).},

Abstract = {Modulation and delta-doping strategies, in which atomically thin layers
   of charged dopants are precisely deposited within a heterostructure,
   have played enabling roles in the discovery of new physical behavior in
   electronic materials. Here, we demonstrate a purely structural
   ``delta-doping{''} strategy in complex oxide heterostructures, in which
   atomically thin manganite layers are inserted into an isovalent
   manganite host, thereby modifying the local rotations of
   corner-connected MnO6 octahedra. Combining scanning transmission
   electron microscopy, polarized neutron reflectometry, and density
   functional theory, we reveal how local magnetic exchange interactions
   are enhanced within the spatially confined regions of suppressed
   octahedral rotations. The combined experimental and theoretical results
   illustrate the potential to utilize noncharge-based approaches to
   ``doping{''} in order to enhance or suppress functional properties
   within spatially confined regions of oxide heterostructures.},

   thin-films},
Journal = {AIP ADVANCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Polarized neutron reflectometry has been used to study interface
   magnetism and magnetic dead layers in model amorphous CoFeB: Ta alloy
   thin-film multilayers with Curie temperatures tuned to be below
   room-temperature. This allows temperature dependent variations in the
   effective magnetic thickness of the film to be determined at
   temperatures that are a significant fraction of the Curie temperature,
   which cannot be achieved in the material systems used for spintronic
   devices. In addition to variation in the effective magnetic thickness
   due to compositional grading at the interface with the tantalum capping
   layer, the key finding is that at the interface between ferromagnetic
   film and GaAs(001) substrate local interfacial alloying creates an
   additional magnetic dead-layer. The thickness of this magnetic
   dead-layer is temperature dependent, which may have significant
   implications for elevated-temperature operation of hybrid ferromagnetic
   metal-semiconductor spintronic devices. (C) 2017 Author(s). All article

Abstract = {Advanced photoinjectors, which are critical to many next generation
   accelerators, open the door to new ways of material probing, both as
   injectors for free electron lasers and for ultra-fast electron
   diffraction. For these applications, the nonuniformity of the electric
   field near the cathode caused by surface roughness can be the dominant
   source of beam emittance. Therefore, improving the photocathode
   roughness while maintaining quantum efficiency is essential to the
   improvement of beam brightness. In this paper, we report the
   demonstration of a bi-alkali antimonide photocathode with an order of
   magnitude improved roughness by sputter deposition from a K2CsSb sputter
   target, using in situ and operando X-ray characterizations. We found
   that a surface roughness of 0.5 nm for a sputtered photocathode with a
   final thickness of 42 nm can be achieved while still yielding a quantum
   efficiency of 3.3\% at 530 nm wavelength. (C) 2017 Author(s).},

Abstract = {The possible realization of dissipationless chiral edge current in a

   by applying an electrical back gate to tune the Fermi level of
   topological insulator to be close to the Dirac point. A phenomenological
   model based on diamagnetic screening is developed to explain the
   suppressed proximity-induced magnetism at high carrier density. Our work
   paves the way to utilize the magnetic proximity effect at the

Abstract = {The DC magnetron sputter grown Co/Ti multilayers, with ultra-low
   bi-layer thicknesses and with Co layers deposited under mixed ambience
   of argon and dry air, have been investigated for use in the water window
   soft x-ray regime of 23 - 44 angstrom. Initially, deposition parameters
   have been optimized for obtaining smooth and continuous low thickness Co
   and Ti single-layer films, and, then, multilayers with five bi-layers of
   various bi-layer thicknesses were deposited. The samples have been
   primarily characterized by the grazing incidence x-ray reflectivity
   (GIXR) measurements with a hard x-ray laboratory source. Subsequently, a
   set of multilayers with an increasing number of bi-layers has been
   deposited with a constant bi-layer thickness of 42 angstrom. GIXR
   results show that hard x-ray reflectivity at the first Bragg peak is
   maximum for the 20 bi-layer sample, beyond which the reflectivity
   decreases. Finally, the samples with the most promising hard x-ray GIXR
   have been used for soft x-ray reflectivity measurement with synchrotron
   radiation, and similar to 2.5\% peak reflectivity has been obtained in
   the multilayer sample at a 30.7 angstrom wavelength for a 21.5 degrees
   grazing angle of incidence. The fitting results for both hard and soft
   x-ray reflectivities have been thoroughly investigated to find out the
   cause of the saturation of reflectivity with the increase in the number
   of bi-layers. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America},

Title = {Interfacial Origin of the Magnetisation Suppression of Thin Film Yttrium
   Iron Garnet},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Yttrium iron garnet has a very high Verdet constant, is transparent in
   the infrared and is an insulating ferrimagnet leading to its use in
   optical and magneto-optical applications. Its high Q-factor has been
   exploited to make resonators and filters in microwave devices, but it
   also has the lowest magnetic damping of any known material. In this
   article we describe the structural and magnetic properties of single
   crystal thin-film YIG where the temperature dependence of the
   magnetisation reveals a decrease in the low temperature region. In order
   to understand this complex material we bring a large number of
   structural and magnetic techniques to bear on the same samples. Through
   a comprehensive analysis we show that at the substrate -YIG interface,
   an interdiffusion zone of only 4-6 nm exists. Due to the interdiffusion
   of Y from the YIG and Gd from the substrate, an addition magnetic layer
   is formed at the interface whose properties are crucially important in
   samples with a thickness of YIG less than 200 nm.},

Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {416},
Pages = {168-177},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Top surface roughness and interface roughness are one of the key
   elements which determine the performance of X-ray and neutron thin film
   multilayer devices. It has been observed that by mixing air with argon
   in sputtering ambience during deposition of Co layers, polarized neutron
   reflectivity (PNR) of Co/Ti supermirror polarizers can be improved
   substantially. Cross-sectional HRTEM measurement reveals that sharper
   interfaces in the supermirror can be achieved in case of deposition of
   the multilayer under mixed ambience of argon and air. In order to
   investigate this interface modification mechanism further, in this
   communication two sets of tri-layer Co/Ti/Co samples and 20-layer Co/Ti
   periodic multilayer samples have been prepared; in one set all the
   layers are deposited only under argon ambience and in the other set, Co
   layers are deposited under a mixed ambience of argon and air. These
   samples have been characterized by measuring specular and non-specular
   X-ray reflectivities (GIXR) with X-rays of 1.54 angstrom wavelength and
   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) with neutron of 2.5 angstrom
   wavelength at grazing angle of incidence. It has been observed that the
   X-ray and neutron specular reflectivities at Bragg peaks of 20 layer
   periodic multilayer increase when Co layers are deposited under mixed
   ambience of argon and air. The detail information regarding the effect
   of air on the interfaces and magnetic properties has been obtained by
   fitting the measured spectra. The above information has subsequently
   been supplemented by XRD and magnetic measurements on the samples. XPS
   and XANES measurements have also been carried out to investigate whether
   cobalt oxide or cobalt nitride layers are being formed due to use of air
   in sputtering ambience. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this study, we have characterized graphene oxide films formed at the

   organized as a bilayer of sheets interfaced between air and water with
   water molecule bridges. Such a spontaneous bilayer structure and its
   evolution with respect to the surface pressure has been observed for the
   first time. These results should allow precise control of the density of
   sheets deposited on the substrate when these films are transferred
   through the Langmuir Blodgett or Schaefer procedures. Indeed, graphene
   oxide keeps on attracting more and more attention, increasing the need
   for the production of well-controlled graphene oxide thin films due to

Abstract = {We investigated the role of microstructure and Co layer thickness on the

   multilayers demonstrated strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with
   their saturation magnetization close to the bulk magnetization of Co.
   Magnetization and magnetic anisotropy increased with annealing and this
   increase is directly linked to the strain relaxation and sharpening of
   the interfaces after annealing. Using XRR analysis before and after
   annealing, and fitting these XRR data, the multilayer periodicities are
   extracted and the refined layer thickness and surface roughness are
   determined. Using XRD analysis and fitting these XRD spectra,

Abstract = {We report measurements on yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films grown on
   both gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG)
   substrates, with and without thin Pt top layers. We provide three
   principal results: the observation of an interfacial region at the
   Pt/YIG interface, we place a limit on the induced magnetism of the Pt
   layer, and confirm the existence of an interfacial layer at the GGG/YIG
   interface. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) was used to give depth
   dependence of both the structure and magnetism of these structures. We
   find that a thin film of YIG on GGG is best described by three distinct
   layers: an interfacial layer near the GGG, around 5 nm thick and
   nonmagnetic, a magnetic ``bulk{''} phase, and a nonmagnetic and
   compositionally distinct thin layer near the surface. We theorize that
   the bottom layer, which is independent of the film thickness, is caused
   by Gd diffusion. The top layer is likely to be extremely important in
   inverse spin Hall effect measurements, and is most likely Y2O3 or very
   similar. Magnetic sensitivity in the PNR to any induced moment in the Pt
   is increased by the existence of the Y2O3 layer; any moment is found to
   be less than 0.02 mu(B)/atom.},

Abstract = {A hollow cathode arc discharge is used for the roll-to-roll deposition
   of silicon-containing plasma polymer thin films on a polymer substrate.
   It is found that the fragmentation of the used monomer
   hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) increases with increasing plasma power. The
   higher fragmentation was related to a reduced hydrogen content as a
   result of breaking CH bonds. This allowed for a higher degree of
   cross-linking. The latter has a positive effect on the barrier
   performance of the coatings. A hollow cathode arc discharge with
   separate anode allowed the deposition of a plasma polymer with a water
   vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 0.16gm(-2)day(-1) (measured at 38
   degrees C and 90\% r.h.) on a PET substrate while maintaining a
   deposition rate of approximately 450nmmmin(-1).},

Abstract = {We study the effect of bilayer thickness at fixed volume fraction on the

   artificial metallic superlattices can be manufactured with excellent
   crystal quality and layering up to at least 50 angstrom in repeat
   distance (K = L-Fe + L-V). For an intended fixed ratio of the
   constituents: L-Fe/L-V=1/7, out-of-plane coherence lengths comparable to
   the thicknesses of the samples were obtained. We evaluate the strain in-
   and out-of-plane of both layers as a function of the bilayer thickness
   and comment on the growth using the framework of linear elasticity
   theory. We interpret the stability of the superlattice against crystal
   degradation due to the alternating compressive and tensile strain,
   yielding close to ideal lattice matching to the substrate. (C) 2017

Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},

Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Here, a quantitative magnetic depth profile across the planar interfaces
   in BiFeO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (BFO/LSMO) superlattices using polarized
   neutron reflectometry is obtained. An enhanced magnetization of 1.83 +/-
   0.16 mu(B)/Fe in BFO layers is observed when they are interleaved
   between two manganite layers. The enhanced magnetic order in BFO
   persists up to 200 K. The depth dependence of magnetic moments in
   BFO/LSMO superlattices as a function of the BFO layer thickness is also
   explored. The results show the enhanced net magnetic moment in BFO from
   the LSMO/BFO interface extends 3-4 unit cells into BFO. The interior
   part of a thicker BFO layer has a much smaller magnetization, suggesting
   it still keeps the small canted AFM state. The results exclude charge
   transfer, intermixing, epitaxial strain, and octahedral rotations/tilts
   as dominating mechanisms for the large net magnetization in BFO. An
   explanation-one suggested by others previously and consistent with the
   observations-attributes the temperature dependence of the net
   magnetization of BFO to strong orbital hybridization between Fe and Mn
   across the interfaces. Such orbital reconstruction would establish an
   upper temperature limit for magnetic ordering of BFO.},

Abstract = {Electronic, lattice, and spin interactions at the interfaces between
   crystalline complex transition-metal oxides can give rise to a wide
   range of functional electronic and magnetic phenomena not found in bulk.
   At heterointerfaces, these interactions may be enhanced by combining
   oxides where the polarity changes at the interface. The physical
   structure between nonpolar SrTiO3 and polar La1-x Sr-x MnO3 (x = 0.2) is
   investigated using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction to
   directly determine the role of structural distortions in compensating
   the polar discontinuity. At both the oxide-oxide interface and
   vacuum-oxide interfaces, the lattice is found to expand and rumple along
   the growth direction. The SrTiO3/La1-x Sr-x MnO3 interface also exhibits
   intermixing of La and Sr over a few unit cells. The results thus
   demonstrate that polar distortions and ionic intermixing coexist and
   both pathways play a significant role at interfaces with polar
   discontinuities.},

Title = {Control of hidden ground-state order in NdNiO3 superlattices},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {The combination of charge and spin degrees of freedom with electronic
   correlations in condensed matter systems leads to a rich array of
   phenomena, such as magnetism, superconductivity, and novel conduction
   mechanisms. While such phenomena are observed in bulk materials, a
   richer array of behaviors becomes possible when these degrees of freedom
   are controlled in atomically layered heterostructures, where one can
   constrain dimensionality and impose interfacial boundary conditions.
   Here, we unlock a host of unique, hidden electronic and magnetic phase
   transitions in NdNiO3 while approaching the two-dimensional (2D) limit,
   resulting from the differing influences of dimensional confinement and
   interfacial coupling. Most notably, we discover a phase in fully 2D,
   single-layer NdNiO3, in which all signatures of the bulk magnetic and
   charge ordering are found to vanish. In addition, for
   quasi-two-dimensional layers down to a thickness of two unit cells,
   bulk-type ordering persists but separates from the onset of insulating
   behavior in a manner distinct from that found in the bulk or thin-film
   nickelates. Using resonant x-ray spectroscopies, first-principles
   theory, and model calculations, we propose that the single-layer phase
   suppression results from an alternative mechanism of interfacial
   electronic reconstruction based on ionicity differences across the
   interface, while the phase separation in multilayer NdNiO3 emerges due
   to enhanced 2D fluctuations. These findings provide insights into the
   intertwined mechanisms of charge and spin ordering in strongly
   correlated systems in reduced dimensions and illustrate the ability to
   use atomic layering to access hidden phases.},

   in this weakly interacting mixture does not have a strong effect on the
   ground state and does not generate a hybrid orbital. We also find a
   strong CT transition in light absorption as well as in photo- and
   electroluminescence. By using different layer sequences and
   compositions, we are able to distinguish electronic coupling in-plane vs
   out-of-plane and, thus, characterize the anisotropy of the CT state.

Abstract = {Understanding the magnetism at the interface between a ferromagnet and
   an insulator is essential because the commonly posited magnetic dead
   layer close to an interface can be problematic in magnetic tunnel
   junctions. Previously, degradation of the magnetic interface was
   attributed to charge discontinuity across the interface. Here, the
   interfacial magnetism was investigated using three identically prepared
   La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) thin films grown on different oriented SrTiO3
   (STO) substrates by polarized neutron reflectometry. In all cases the
   magnetization at the LSMO/STO interface is larger than the film bulk. We
   show that the interfacial magnetization is largest across the LSMO/STO
   interfaces with (001) and (111) orientations, which have the largest net
   charge discontinuities across the interfaces. In contrast, the
   magnetization of LSMO/STO across the (110) interface, the orientation
   with no net charge discontinuity, is the smallest of the three
   orientations. We show that a magnetically degraded interface is not
   intrinsic to LSMO/STO heterostructures. The approach to use different
   crystallographic orientations provides a means to investigate the
   influence of charge discontinuity on the interfacial magnetization.},

Abstract = {We report the characteristics of an amorphous oxide semiconductor
   In-Si-O fabricated via solution processing. In-Si-O thin films with
   nominal silicon concentration of 0 at.\%, 1 at.\%, 3 at.\%, 5 at.\%, 9
   at.\%, 50 at.\%, and 100 at.\% were fabricated via spin coating. The
   films were characterized via thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS),
   x-ray reflectivity, x-ray diffraction (XRD), extended x-ray absorption
   fine structure (EXAFS), and electrical resistance measurements. TDS
   analysis suggested that organic residues, such as organic functional
   groups from raw materials and solvents, were almost completely desorbed
   from the films at approximately 400A degrees C. The XRD and EXAFS
   analyses confirmed that pure In2O3 crystallizes at approximately 350A
   degrees C and that the crystallization temperature increases with the
   silicon concentration. In-Si-O films with silicon concentration above 3
   at.\% exhibited high electrical resistance, indicating that films
   fabricated via spin coating contain few oxygen vacancies. These results
   suggest that In-Si-O thin films have significant potential for use as
   channels in field-effect transistors designed for next-generation
   flat-panel displays.},

Abstract = {Structural, interfacial, optical, and transport properties of large-area
   MoS2 ultra-thin films on BN-buffered silicon substrates fabricated using
   magnetron sputtering are investigated. A relatively simple growth
   strategy is demonstrated here that simultaneously promotes superior
   interfacial and bulk MoS2 properties. Few layers of MoS2 are established
   using x-ray reflectivity, diffraction, ellipsometry, and Raman
   spectroscopy measurements. Layer-specific modeling of optical constants
   show very good agreement with first-principles calculations.
   Conductivity measurements reveal that few-layer MoS2 films are more
   conducting than many-layer films. Photo-conductivity measurements reveal
   that the sputter deposited MoS2 films compare favorably with other
   large-area methods. Our work illustrates that sputtering is a viable
   route for large-area device applications using transition metal
   dichalcogenides.},

   ultra-thin films},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E-ALD) technique has
   demonstrated to be a suitable process for growing compound
   semiconductors, by alternating the under-potential deposition (UPD) of
   the metallic element with the UPD of the non-metallic element. The cycle
   can be repeated several times to build up films with sub-micrometric
   thickness. We show that it is possible to grow, by E-ALD, Cu2S
   ultra-thin films on Ag(111) with high structural quality. They show a
   well ordered layered crystal structure made on alternating
   pseudohexagonal layers in lower coordination. As reported in literature
   for minerals in the Cu-S compositional field, these are based on CuS3
   triangular groups, with layers occupied by highly mobile Cu ions. This
   structural model is closely related to the one of the low chalcocite.
   The domain size of such films is more than 1000 angstrom in lateral size
   and extends with a high crystallinity in the vertical growth direction
   up to more than 10 nm. E-ALD process results in the growth of highly
   ordered and almost unstrained ultra-thin films. This growth can lead to
   the design of semiconductors with optimal transport proprieties by an
   appropriate doping of the intra metallic layer. The present study
   enables E-ALD as an efficient synthetic route for the growth of
   semiconducting heterostructures with tailored properties.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {121},
Number = {17},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {The scientific and technological interest for metal-dielectric
   nanocomposite thin films emanates from the excitation of localized
   surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) on the metal component. The overall
   optical response of the nanocomposite is governed by the refractive
   index of the dielectric matrix and the properties of the metallic
   nanoparticles in terms of their bulk optical properties, size, and
   shape, and the inter-particle distance of separation. In order to tune
   the film morphology and optical properties, complex synthesis processes
   which include multiple steps-i. e., film deposition followed by
   post-deposition treatment by thermal or laser annealing-are commonly
   employed. In the present study, we demonstrate that the absorption
   resonances of Ag/AlOxNy nanocomposite films can be effectively tuned
   from green (similar to 2.4 eV) to violet (similar to 2.8 eV) using a
   single-step synthesis process that is based on modulating the arrival
   pattern of film forming species with sub-monolayer resolution, while
   keeping the amount of Ag in the films constant. Our data indicate that
   the optical response of the films is the result of LSPRs on isolated Ag
   nanoparticles that are seemingly shifted by dipolar interactions between
   neighboring particles. The synthesis strategy presented may be of
   relevance for enabling integration of plasmonic nanocomposite films on
   thermally sensitive substrates. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {Tritium betavoltaics are one of the family of nuclear batteries which
   convert natural radioactive decay from a radioisotope into electricity
   that can provide continuous power without the requirement for
   replacement or recharging. Tritium is ideally suited to this application
   due to its high specific activity, low shielding requirements and
   relatively high availability. Owing to safety and environmental concerns
   over tritium leakage, metal tritides films are preferred as tritium
   betavoltaic sources. Titanium hydride and deuteride films were studied
   as analogues to titanium tritide films. The quality of the films
   depended on the temperature of hydrogen loading as films loaded at
   elevated temperatures (>100 degrees C) were brittle and delaminated from
   the semiconductor substrate while those exposed to hydrogen at room
   temperature continued to adhere to the substrate. For the latter films,
   evidence of hydrogen isotope loss was observed when left under ambient
   conditions over the course of a few weeks.},

Abstract = {Optical bandgap properties of high-quality few-layer topological

   blue shift is robust and observed in both protected (capped) and exposed
   (uncapped) thin films. The behavior is strongest below six quintuple
   layers (QLs), particularly at the 2 and 3 QL level, where finite-size
   effects are known to be most significant in Bi2Se3. A further bandgap
   increase is observed in all films that we attribute to the Burstein-Moss
   effect. Our result provides additional insights into the scaling
   behavior of topological materials. The bandgap increase has a
   significant impact on the electronic and optoelectronic applications of

Abstract = {Magnetization dynamics of a Co/Ni multilayer film capped by a wedged Ta
   (0.3-1.3 nm) layer were investigated using time-resolved magneto-optic
   Kerr microscopy. The ferromagnetic resonance was observed for a wide
   range of magnetic fields in a variety of geometries. Using a macro-spin
   approximation and the Kittel formula to evaluate the relaxation
   frequency, a significant increase of the effective anisotropy field was
   observed as the Ta layer thickness is increased. Furthermore, the
   damping behavior of the magnetization precession also shows a strong
   dependence on the Ta layer thickness. Using a model to account for
   variations of the local anisotropy fields, we reproduce the field
   evolution of the observed damping using a single Gilbert damping
   parameter for the Co/Ni system. These findings have direct implications
   for the rational design of novel spintronic devices. Published by AIP

   maximum does not correspond to the manganite Curie temperature but
   results from a con(v)olution of properties of the near-insulating

Abstract = {The initial growth of DC sputtered ZrO2 on top of a-Si, SiN, and SiO2
   layers has been studied by in vacuo high-sensitivity low energy ion
   scattering for two gas deposition conditions with different oxygen
   contents (high-O and low-O conditions). This unique surface sensitive
   technique allowed the determination of surface composition and
   thicknesses required to close the ZrO2 layer on all three substrates for
   both conditions. The ZrO2 layer closes similarly on all substrates due
   to more favorable enthalpies of formation for ZrO2 and ZrSiO4, resulting
   in passivation of the Si from the substrate. However, this layer closes
   at about half of the thickness (similar to 1.7 nm) for low-O conditions
   due to less oxidative conditions and less energetic particles arriving
   at the sample, which leads to less intermixing via silicate formation.
   In contrast, for high-O conditions, there is more ZrSiO4 and/or SiOx
   formation, giving more intermixing (similar to 3.4 nm). In vacuo X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed similar
   stoichiometric ZrO2 layers deposited by both conditions and a higher
   interaction of the ZrO2 layer with the underlying a-Si for high-O
   conditions. In addition, oxygen diffusion through low-O ZrO2 films on
   a-Si has been investigated by ex situ angular-resolved XPS of samples
   annealed in atmospheric oxygen. For temperatures below 400 degrees C, no
   additional oxidation of the underlying a-Si was observed. This, together
   with the amorphous nature and smoothness of these samples, makes ZrO2 a
   good candidate as an oxidation protective layer on top of a-Si.

Abstract = {The structural configuration of molecules assembled at organic-inorganic
   interfaces within electronic materials strongly influences the
   functional electronic and vibrational properties relevant to
   applications ranging from energy storage to photovoltaics. Controlling
   and characterizing the structural state of an interface and its
   evolution under external stimuli is crucial both for the fundamental
   understanding of the factors influenced by molecular structure and for
   the development of methods for material synthesis. It has been
   challenging to create complete molecular monolayers that exhibit
   external reversible control of the structure and electronic
   configuration. We report a monolayer/inorganic interface consisting of
   an organic monolayer assembled on an oxide surface, exhibiting
   structural and electronic reconfiguration under ultraviolet
   illumination. The molecular monolayer is linked to the surface through a
   carboxylate link, with the backbone bearing an azobenzene functional
   group and the head group consisting bipyridine group. Optical
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,
   and X-ray reflectivity show that closely packed monolayers are formed
   from these molecules via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Reversible
   photoisomerization is observed in solution and in monolayers assembled
   on Si and quartz substrates. The reconfiguration of these monolayers
   provides additional means to control excitation and charge transfer
   processes that are important in applications in catalysis, molecular
   electronics, and solar energy conversion.},

Abstract = {The effects of extra H2O-modulated oxidation are reported on the
   structural, optical, and electrical properties of nonpolar m-plane ZnO
   thin films grown on m-plane Al2O3 substrates by atomic layer deposition.
   Films without modulation, one modulated layer, and two modulated layers
   are compared. Structural properties studied using x-ray reflectivity,
   x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy show that all
   the films have a largely similar thickness and epitaxial relations with
   their substrates, but the rocking curves grow broader as the number of
   modulations increases. However, the extra layer of water modulation
   reduces the surface roughness drastically and also improves the
   electrical properties as compared to the unmodulated ZnO films. Water
   modulation is believed to serve as a source of atomic oxygen that
   promotes compensation of the pre-existing oxygen vacancies. The films
   tend to exhibit larger mosaicity around the a-axis as compared to that
   around the c-axis. (C) 2017 American Vacuum Society.},

Abstract = {The current work investigates the microstructure and property relations
   of molybdenum oxide thin films synthesized by reactive dc magnetron
   sputtering in an industrial-scale sputter deposition plant using a
   rotatable molybdenum target with varying oxygen/argon gas flow ratio.
   The evolution of microstructure and chemical bonds as a function of
   oxygen partial pressure was studied by x-ray diffraction, Raman
   spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With oxygen partial
   pressure raising from 0\% to 100\%, the film growth rate decreased from
   350 to 50 nm/min, while the oxygen content within the films increased up
   to 75 at. \%. The films were dominated by MoO2, polymorphs of Mo4O11 and
   Mo9O26, and MoO3 phases. The electrical properties changed from
   electrically conductive to insulating with increasing oxygen partial
   pressure. The optical properties are versatile, e.g., transmittance
   values up to 80\%, absorbance values between 50\% and 80\% and
   reflectance values up to 55\%, depending on the oxygen content. In
   general, it can be concluded that microstructure and properties of
   molybdenum oxide thin films can be adjusted by varying the oxygen/argon
   gas flow ratio and might thus enable their use in a wide range of
   optical and electronic applications. (C) 2017 American Vacuum Society.},

Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},

Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {The orthorhombically distorted perovskite NaMnF3 has been predicted to
   become ferroelectric if an a = c distortion of the bulk Pnma structure
   is imposed. In order to test this prediction, NaMnF3 thin films were
   grown on SrTiO3 (001) single crystal substrates via molecular beam
   epitaxy. The best films were smooth and single phase with four different
   twin domains. In-plane magnetization measurements revealed the presence
   of antiferromagnetic ordering with weak ferromagnetism below the Neel
   temperature T-N = 66 K. For the dielectric studies, NaMnF3 films were
   grown on a 30 nm SrRuO3 (001) layer used as a bottom electrode grown via
   pulsed laser deposition. The complex permittivity as a function of
   frequency indicated a strong Debye-like relaxation contribution
   characterized by a distribution of relaxation times. A power-law
   divergence of the characteristic relaxation time revealed an
   order-disorder phase transition at 8 K. The slow relaxation dynamics
   indicated the formation of superdipoles (superparaelectric moments) that
   extend over several unit cells, similar to polar nanoregions of relaxor
   ferroelectrics. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {The interaction of water with metal oxide surfaces plays a crucial role
   in the catalytic and geochemical behavior of metal oxides. In a vast
   majority of studies, the interfacial structure is assumed to arise from
   a relatively static lowest energy configuration of atoms, even at room
   temperature. Using hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as a model oxide, we show
   through a direct comparison of in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering with
   density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations that the
   structure of the (1 (1) over bar 02) termination is dynamically
   stabilized by picosecond water exchange. Simulations show frequent
   exchanges between terminal aquo groups and adsorbed water in locations
   and with partial residence times consistent with experimentally
   determined atomic sites and fractional occupancies. Frequent water
   exchange occurs even for an ultrathin adsorbed water film persisting on
   the surface under a dry atmosphere. The resulting time averaged
   interfacial structure consists of a ridged lateral arrangement of
   adsorbed water molecules hydrogen bonded to terminal aquo groups.
   Surface pK(a) prediction based on bond valence analysis suggests that
   water exchange will influence the proton-transfer reactions underlying
   the acid/base reactivity at the interface. Our findings provide
   important new insights for understanding complex interfacial chemical
   processes at metal oxide water interfaces.},

Abstract = {K2CsSb is a promising photocathode candidate to serve as an electron
   source in next-generation light sources such as Free Electron Lasers
   (FEL) and Energy Recovery Linacs (ERL). As the traditional recipe for
   creation of K2CsSb photocathodes typically results in a rough surface
   that deteriorates electron beam quality, significant effort has been
   made to explore novel growth methods for K2CsSb photocathodes. In this
   paper, a method of ternary co-evaporation of K, Cs, and Sb is described.
   By using in-situ synchrotron X-ray techniques, the quality of the
   photocathode is characterized during and after the growth. K2CsSb
   photocathodes grown by this method on Si (100) and MgO (001) substrates
   show strong (222) texture, and the two photocathodes exhibit 1.7\% and
   3.4\% quantum efficiencies at a wavelength of 530 nm, with a rms surface
   roughness of about 2-4 nm. This represents an order of magnitude
   reduction in roughness compared to typical sequential deposition and
   should result in a significant improvement in the brightness of the
   generated electron beam. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {Structural and magnetic properties of 1-10 nm thick Fe films deposited
   on GaN(0001) were investigated. In-situ reflecting high energy electron
   diffraction images indicated a alpha-Fe(110)/GaN(0001) growth of the 3D
   Volmer-Weber type. The alpha-Fe(110) X-ray diffraction peak showed a 1
   degrees full-width at half-maximum, indicating approximate to 20 nm
   grain sizes. A significant reduction in Fe atomic moment from its bulk
   value was observed for films thinner than 4 nm. Both GaN/Fe interface
   roughness and Fe film coercivity increased with Fe thickness, indicating
   a possible deterioration of Fe crystalline quality. Magnetic anisotropy
   was mainly uniaxial for all films while hexagonal anisotropies appeared
   for thicknesses higher than 3.7 nm. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {Amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors are a leading contender
   for active channel materials in next generation flat panel displays and
   flexible electronics. Improved electronic functionality has been linked
   to the increased density of a-IGZO, and while much work has looked at
   hightemperature processes, studies at temperatures compatible with
   flexible substrates are needed. Here, compositional and structural
   analyses show that short term, low-temperature annealing (< 6 h) can
   increase the density of sputtered a-IGZO by up to 5.6\% for temperatures
   below 300 degrees C, which is expected to improve the transistor
   performance, while annealing for longer times leads to a subsequent
   decrease in density due to oxygen absorption.},

   Electrodeposition in Ionic Liquids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Elementary steps in the electrochemical reduction process of SiCl4 in
   trimethyl-n-hexylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (TMHATFSI)
   was investigated, focusing on molecular level behavior of the reactants
   at solid-liquid interface. Electrochemical measurements using an
   electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) identified a
   reduction peak corresponding to Si electrodeposition and several
   elementary steps with stable intermediates forming prior to the
   deposition. For detailed analysis, X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements
   with synchrotron radiation were applied in situ. The change in
   reflectivity of the electrode surface during the deposition was found to
   be due to the formation of a polymer-like Si such as Si2Cl6, which is an
   intermediate layer during the deposition process. These results were
   theoretically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations:
   after an electron transfers from the electrode, the Si in SiCl4 forms
   the bond with another SiCl4, rather than the Si of the substrate,
   resulting in the formation of the intermediate structure. These data
   suggest an elementary step in the SiCl4 reduction process which can be
   described as follows; when SiCl4 is reduced, a polymer-like Si form such
   as Si2Cl6 is generated. This intermediate species further reacts with
   other Si reactants after receiving additional electrons, which then
   finally deposits as Si on the substrate. (c) The Author(s) 2017.

Abstract = {Electrochemical behavior of Ni in an alkaline heavy water electrolyte
   was studied using cyclic voltammetry and polarized neutron
   reflectometry. Delays in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on
   Ni electrodes and slower kinetics of the reactions in heavy water
   compared to light water were observed. However, in both 0.01 mol/L NaOH
   light and heavy water solutions, Ni oxidation and passive film formation
   occurred at the same potential with similar passive current densities
   indicating a minor isotope effect of deuterium on passive film formation
   and growth. Polarized neutron reflectometry detected a passive film
   growth coefficient of 11.5 +/- 1.1 angstrom/V. The Ni consumption
   coefficient was determined to be 7.3 +/- 1.5 angstrom/V. Ni oxidation
   and passive film growth occurred mostly during the transient period
   after the applied potential increase but was negligible at the steady
   state. The electric field strength across the passive film was 8 x 106
   V/cm. The Pilling-Bedworth ratio of the passive film during
   potentiostatic growth was close to the value of NiO grown on bulk Ni.
   This work demonstrated the capability of neutron reflectometry in the
   study of passive films on metals and alloys. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Abstract = {Epitaxial thin films of the proton-conducting perovskite
   BaZr0.53In0.47O3-delta H0.47-2 delta, grown by pulsed laser deposition,
   were investigated in their hydrated and dehydrated conditions through a
   multitechniqu approach with the aim to study the structure and proton
   concentration depth profile and their relationship to proton
   conductivity. The techniques used were X-ray diffraction, X-ray and
   neutron reflectivity, nuclear reaction analysis, and Rutherford
   backscattering, together with impedance spectroscopy. The obtained
   proton conductivity and activation energy are comparable to literature
   values for the bulk conductivity of similar materials, thus showing that
   grain-boundary conductivity is negligible due to the high crystallinity
   of the film. The results reveal an uneven proton concentration depth
   profile, with the presence of a 3-4 nm thick, proton-rich layer with
   altered composition, likely characterized by cationic deficiency. While
   this surface layer either retains or reobtains protons after desorption
   and cooling to room temperature, the bulk of the film absorbs and
   desorbs protons in the expected mariner. It is suggested that the
   protons in the near-surface, proton rich region are located in proton
   sites characterized by relatively strong O-H bonds due to weak
   hydrogen-bond interactions to neighboring oxygen atoms and that the
   mobility of protons in these sites is generally lower than in proton
   sites associated with stronger hydrogen bonds. It follows that strongly
   hydrogen-bonding configurations are important for high proton mobility.},

Abstract = {Exchange bias and interlayer exchange coupling are interface driven
   phenomena. Since an ideal interface is very challenging to achieve, a
   clear understanding of the chemical and magnetic natures of interfaces
   is pivotal to identify their influence on the magnetism. We have chosen
   Ni80Fe20/CoO(t(CoO))/Co trilayers as a model system, and identified
   non-stoichiometric Ni-ferrite and Co-ferrite at the surface and
   interface, respectively. These ferrites, being ferrimagnets typically,
   should influence the exchange coupling. However, in our trilayers the
   interface ferrites were found not to be ferro-or ferri-magnetic; thus
   having no observable influence on the exchange coupling. Our analysis
   also revealed that (i) interlayer exchange coupling was present between
   Ni80Fe20 and Co even though the interlayer thickness was significantly
   larger than expected for this phenomenon to happen, and (ii) the
   majority of the CoO layer (except some portion near the interface) did
   not contribute to the observed exchange bias. We also identified that
   the interlayer exchange coupling and the exchange bias properties were
   not interdependent.},

Title = {Realisation of magnetically and atomically abrupt
   half-metal/semiconductor interface: Co2FeSi0.5Al0.5/Ge(111)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Halfmetal-semiconductor interfaces are crucial for hybrid spintronic
   devices. Atomically sharp interfaces with high spin polarisation are
   required for efficient spin injection. In this work we show that thin
   film of half-metallic full Heusler alloy Co2FeSi0.5Al0.5 with uniform
   thickness and B2 ordering can form structurally abrupt interface with
   Ge(111). Atomic resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals
   that there is a small outdiffusion of Ge into specific atomic planes of
   the Co2FeSi0.5Al0.5 film, limited to a very narrow similar to 1 nm
   interface region. First-principles calculations show that this selective
   outdiffusion along the Fe-Si/Al atomic planes does not change the
   magnetic moment of the film up to the very interface. Polarized neutron
   reflectivity, x-ray reflectivity and aberration-corrected electron
   microscopy confirm that this interface is both magnetically and
   structurally abrupt. Finally, using first-principles calculations we
   show that this experimentally realised interface structure, terminated
   by Co-Ge bonds, preserves the high spin polarization at the
   Co2FeSi0.5Al0.5/Ge interface, hence can be used as a model to study spin
   injection from half-metals into semiconductors.},

Title = {Surface structure of coherently strained ceria ultrathin films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Number = {20},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Cerium oxide, or ceria, is an important material for solid oxide fuel
   cells and water splitting devices. Although the ceria surface is active
   in catalytic and electrochemical reactions, how its catalytic properties
   are affected by the surface structure under operating conditions is far
   from understood. We investigate the structure of the coherently strained
   CeO2 ultrathin films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (001) single crystals
   by specular synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) under oxidizing
   conditions as a first step to study the surface structure in situ. An
   excellent agreement between the experiment data and the model is
   achieved by using a ``stacks and islands{''} model that has a
   two-component roughness. One component is due to the tiny clusters of
   nanometer scale in lateral dimensions on each terrace, while the other
   component is due to slightly different CeO2 thickness that span over
   hundreds of nanometers on neighboring terraces. We attribute the
   nonuniform thickness to step depairing during the thin film deposition
   that is supported by the surface morphology results on the microscopic
   level. Importantly, our model also shows that the polarity of the ceria
   surface is removed by a half monolayer surface coverage of oxygen. The
   successful resolution of the ceria surface structure using in situ
   specular synchrotron XRD paves the way to study the structural evolution
   of ceria as a fuel cell electrode under catalytically relevant
   temperatures and gas pressures.},

Abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that nanoscale molecular films can
   spontaneously assemble to self-generate intrinsic electric fields that
   can exceed 10(8) V/m. These electric fields originate from polarization
   charges in the material that arise because the films self-assemble to
   orient molecular dipole moments. This has been called the spontelectric
   effect. Such growth of spontaneously polarized layers of molecular
   solids has implications for our understanding of how intermolecular
   interactions dictate the structure of molecular materials used in a
   range of applications, for example, molecular semiconductors, sensors,
   and catalysts. Here we present the first in situ structural
   characterization of a representative spontelectric solid, nitrous oxide.
   Infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and neutron
   reflectivity measurements demonstrate that polarized films of nitrous
   oxide undergo a structural phase transformation upon heating above 48 K
   A mean-field model can be used to describe quantitatively the magnitude
   of the spontaneously generated field as a function of film-growth
   temperature, and this model also recreates the phase change. This
   reinforces the spontelectric model as a means of describing long-range
   dipole-dipole interactions and points to a new type of ordering in
   molecular thin films.},

Abstract = {The impact of interfacial electronic reconstruction on the magnetic

   heterostructures was investigated as a function of layer thickness using
   a combination of soft x-ray magnetic spectroscopy and bulk magnetometry.
   We found that the magnetic properties of the LSCO layers are impacted by
   two competing electronic interactions occurring at the LSCO/substrate
   and LSMO/LSCO interfaces. For thin LSCO layers (<5 nm), the
   heterostructures exist in a highly coupled state where the chemically
   distinct layers behave as a single magnetic compound with magnetically
   active Co2+ ions. As the LSCO thickness increases, a high coercivity
   LSCO layer develops which biases a low coercivity layer, which is
   composed not only of the LSMO layer but also an interfacial LSCO layer.
   These results suggest an intriguing route to tune the magnetic
   properties of transition metal oxide heterostructures through careful
   control of the interface structure. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {In the present study we compare a structure of a Langmuir film assembled
   from magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on water surface and a structure
   of the same film after its transfer to a solid substrate by the

   liquid and on a solid substrate - the film was identified as a
   well-ordered monolayer of the nanoparticles laterally organized in a
   two-dimensional hexagonal lattice. However parameters of the lattice
   were found to be slightly different depending on the type of the
   substrate. It is also demonstrated that Langmuir-Schaefer technique is
   the right way for deposition of such kind of the particles on a solid

   contradicting the often-invoked picture in which changes in orbital
   energy levels generate orbital polarization. Instead, O K-edge x-ray
   absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that orbital polarization is caused
   by an anisotropic reconstruction of the oxygen ligand hole states. This
   provides an explanation for the limited success of theoretical
   predictions based on tuning orbital energy levels and implies that
   future theories should focus on anisotropic hybridization as the most
   effective means to drive large changes in electronic structure and

Title = {Micro-imaging of buried layers and interfaces in ultrathin films by
   X-ray reflectivity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {120},
Number = {11},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {X-ray reflectivity is a promising technique for characterizing buried
   layers and interfaces in ultrathin films because of its ability to probe
   the electron density profile along the depth in a non-destructive
   manner. While routine X-ray reflectivity assumes the in-plane uniformity
   of the sample to be measured, it is also quite important to see buried
   inhomogeneous/patterned layers and interfaces. The present paper
   describes the addition of spatial resolution and imaging capability to
   an X-ray reflectivity technique to visualize surfaces and buried
   interfaces. To visualize quite wide viewing area size quickly, the image
   reconstruction scheme has been employed instead of the scanning of
   microbeam. Though the mathematics is quite close to X-ray computer
   tomography, the technique gives the image contrast caused by the
   difference in reflectivity at each in-plane point in the thin film
   sample. By choosing a grazing angle, the image gives inhomogeneity of
   X-ray reflectivity at the specific wavevector transfer. With a
   collimated monochromatic synchrotron X-ray beam of 0.05mm (H) x 8mm (V),
   the intensity profiles of X-ray reflection projections have been taken
   at many different in-plane rotation angles, from 0 degrees to 180
   degrees. We have succeeded in visualizing buried layers and interfaces
   of the 8mm dia area with the spatial resolution of better than 20 mu m.
   Because of the brilliance of synchrotron radiation, the typical
   measuring time is shorter than 1min. Three analytical cases have been
   discussed: (i) imaging of a buried layer and an interface covered by a
   protection layer, (ii) distinguishing different local parts of different
   thicknesses in an ultrathin film, and (iii) selective imaging of a
   specific metal in the thin film form. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {SrTiO3 is not only of enduring interest due to its unique dielectric,
   structural, and lattice dynamical properties, but is also the archetypal
   perovskite oxide semiconductor and a foundational material in oxide
   heterostructures and electronics. This has naturally focused attention
   on growth, stoichiometry, and defects in SrTiO3, one exciting recent
   development being such precisely stoichiometric defect-managed thin
   films that electron mobilities have finally exceeded bulk crystals. This
   has been achieved only by molecular beam epitaxy, however (and to a
   somewhat lesser extent pulsed laser deposition (PLD)), and numerous open
   questions remain. Here, we present a study of the stoichiometry,
   defects, and structure in SrTiO3 synthesized by a different method, high
   pressure oxygen sputtering, relating the results to electronic
   transport. We find that this form of sputter deposition is also capable
   of homoepitaxy of precisely stoichiometric SrTiO3, but only provided
   that substrate and target preparation, temperature, pressure, and
   deposition rate are carefully controlled. Even under these conditions,
   oxygen-vacancy-doped heteroepitaxial SrTiO3 films are found to have
   carrier density, mobility, and conductivity significantly lower than
   bulk. While surface depletion plays a role, it is argued from
   particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) measurements of trace impurities
   in commercial sputtering targets that this is also due to deep acceptors
   such as Fe at 100's of parts-per-million levels. Comparisons of PIXE
   from SrTiO3 crystals and polycrystalline targets are shown to be of
   general interest, with clear implications for sputter and PLD deposition
   of this important material. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {Differently oriented CeO2 thin films were prepared by radio frequency
   magnetron sputter deposition from a nominally undoped CeO2 target.
   (111), (110) and (100) oriented films were achieved by deposition onto

   to determine the ionization potential, work function, Fermi level
   position and Ce3+ concentration at the surface in dependence of crystal
   orientation, deposition conditions and post-deposition treatment in
   reducing and oxidizing atmosphere. We observed a very high variation of
   the work function and ionization potential of more than 2 eV for all
   surface orientations, while the Fermi level varies by only 0.3 eV within
   the energy gap. The work function generally decreases with increasing
   Ce3+ surface concentration but comparatively high Ce3+ concentrations
   remain even after strongly oxidizing treatments. This is related to the
   presence of subsurface oxygen vacancies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {94},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {We report the relationship between epitaxial strain and the
   crystallographic orientation of the in-phase rotation axis and A-site
   displacements in Pbnm-type perovskite films. Synchrotron diffraction
   measurements of EuFeO3 films under strain states ranging from 2\%
   compressive to 0.9\% tensile on cubic or rhombohedral substrates exhibit
   a combination of a(-)a(+)c(-) and a(+)a(-)c(-) rotational patterns. We
   compare the EuFeO3 behavior with previously reported experimental and
   theoretical work on strained Pbnm-type films on nonorthorhombic
   substrates, as well as additional measurements from LaGaO3, LaFeO3, and
   Eu0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films on SrTiO3. Compiling the results from various
   material systems reveals a general strain dependence in which
   compressive strain strongly favors a(-)a(+)c(-) and a(+)a(-)c(-)
   rotation patterns and tensile strain weakly favors a(-)a(-)c(+)
   structures. In contrast, EuFeO3 films grown on Pbnm-type GdScO3 under
   2.3\% tensile strain take on a uniform a(-)a(+)c(-) rotation pattern
   imprinted from the substrate, despite strain considerations that favor
   the a(-)a(-)c(+) pattern. These results point to the use of substrate
   imprinting as a more robust route than strain for tuning the
   crystallographic orientations of the octahedral rotations and A-site
   displacements needed to realize rotation-induced hybrid improper
   ferroelectricity in oxide heterostructures.},

Abstract = {This paper is a continuation and extension of our earlier work (X-ray
   Spectrom. 2010, 39, 127-134, DOI:10.1002/xrs.1215) on the development of
   a software platform CATGIXRF, as a solution to provide non-destructive
   evaluation of nanostructured materials. Here, we describe an interactive
   graphical user interface (GUI) for the CATGIXRF program. The newly
   developed GUI interface facilitates determination of microstructural
   parameters on angstrom length scale for the nanostructured thin layered
   materials using synchrotron as well as laboratory X-ray sources. It
   allows combined analysis capabilities for both the X-ray reflectivity
   and grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) data simultaneously,
   thus enabling us a greater sensitivity for the determination of
   microstructural parameters such as thickness, interface mixing, and
   roughness of a thin film medium with improved accuracies. The utility
   and various newly added salient features of the GUI-CATGIXRF program are
   described by providing example calculations as well as by analyzing
   experimentally a few thin film structures with different
   surface-interface properties. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Structural, electronic, and magnetic investigation of magnetic ordering
   in MBE-grown CrxSb2-xTe3 thin films},
Journal = {EPL},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {We report the structural, electronic, and magnetic study of Cr-doped
   Sb2Te3 thin films grown by a two-step deposition process using
   molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). The samples were investigated using a
   variety of complementary techniques, namely, x-ray diffraction (XRD),
   atomic force microscopy, SQUID magnetometry, magneto-transport, and
   polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR). It is found that the samples
   retain good crystalline order up to a doping level of x = 0.42 (in
   CrxSb2-xTe3), above which degradation of the crystal structure is
   observed by XRD. Fits to the recorded XRD spectra indicate a general
   reduction in the c-axis lattice parameter as a function of doping,
   consistent with substitutional doping with an ion of smaller ionic
   radius. The samples show soft ferromagnetic behavior with the easy axis
   of magnetization being out-of-plane. The saturation magnetization is
   dependent on the doping level, and reaches from similar to 2 mu B to
   almost 3 mu B per Cr ion. The transition temperature (T-c) depends
   strongly on the Cr concentration and is found to increase with doping
   concentration. For the highest achievable doping level for phase-pure
   films of x = 0.42, a T-c of 125K was determined. Electric transport
   measurements find surface-dominated transport below similar to 10K. The
   magnetic properties extracted from anomalous Hall effect data are in
   excellent agreement with the magnetometry data. PNR studies indicate a
   uniform magnetization profile throughout the film, with no indication of
   enhanced magnetic order towards the sample surface. open access editor's

Abstract = {Neutron reflectometry has been successfully used to study adsorption on
   a stainless steel surface by means of depositing a thin steel film on
   silicon. The, film was characterized using XPS (X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy), TOF-SIMS (time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectrometry), and GIXRD (grazing incidence X-ray diffraction),
   demonstrating the retention both of the austenitic phase and of the
   required composition for 316L stainless steel. The adsorption of
   fibrinogen from a physiologically-relevant solution onto the steel
   surface was studied using neutron reflectometry and QCM (quartz crystal
   microbalance) and compared to that on a deposited chromium oxide
   surface. It was found that the protein forms an irreversibly bound layer
   at low concentrations, with maximum protein concentration a distance of
   around 20 A from the surface. Evidence for a further diffuse
   reversibly-bound layer forming at higher concentrations was also
   observed. Both the structure of the layer revealed by the neutron
   reflectometry data and the high water retention predicted by the QCM
   data suggest that there is a significant extent of protein unfolding
   upon adsorption. A lower extent of adsorption was seen on the chromium
   surfaces, although the adsorbed layer structures were similar,
   suggesting comparable adsorption mechanisms.},

Abstract = {To demonstrate the capability of growing conductive interfaces through

   reflectivity (XRR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements.
   This paper reports on the structural properties of LAO/STO interfaces
   and discusses the interfacial quality and layer-to-layer uniformity
   based on a fitting of the XRR data. In terms of structural properties,
   the LAO/STO film deposited within the 1.35-inch range had the best
   surface among all investigated samples.},

   multilayer for water window application},
Journal = {VACUUM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {85-90},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ultrathin B4C barrier layers have been recently used to reduce the
   interface widths of soft X-ray Cr/V multilayers and improve the
   reflectance at the water window region. To further study the chemical
   changes in the multilayer induced by the barrier layers, Cr/V
   multilayers (period equals to 4 nm) with and without B4C barrier layers
   were characterized by grazing incidence X-ray reflectometry (GIXR) and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The GIXR results show that the
   B4C barrier layers significantly reduce the interface widths of the 4
   nm-period Cr/V multilayer as already observed for the short-period
   multilayer. The XPS depth profile confirms an enhanced elemental
   contrast between Cr and V in the multilayer with B4C, as compared to the
   one with no barriers. According to the fitting results of the
   photoelectron peaks, the compound formation of VB2, extra VC and B4C
   were found in the structure with barrier layers. These compounds help
   suppress the interdiffusion between Cr and V and contribute to the small
   interface widths of the multilayer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The electronic properties of digital superlattices are reported, which
   are cation-ordered analogs of the perovskite La1/3Sr2/3FeO3, a material
   that undergoes a charge-ordering transition. Superlattices of LaFeO3
   (LFO), an antiferromagnetic insulator, and SrFeO3 (SFO), a conductor
   with a helical magnetic ground state, are fabricated via oxide molecular
   beam epitaxy. Three isocompositional superlattices with repeat
   structures of SSLSSL (S2), SSSLSL (S3), and SSSSLL (S4) (S = SFO, L =
   LFO) are studied with cation orderings along the {[}001] and {[}111]
   directions for experimental and computational work, respectively. The
   experimental superlattice structures are confirmed via synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction and corresponding simulations of (00 L) crystal truncation
   rods. The S2 and S3 superlattices are found to undergo an electronic
   phase transition as measured by a discontinuity in the
   temperature-dependent resistivity similar to the random alloy,
   indicating that the superlattices do not behave as a simple combination
   of LFO and SFO. The charge-ordering transition is not observed in the S4
   sample. The electronic structure calculations using density functional
   theory, confirming the energetic favorability of charge ordering in the
   S2 and S3 structures compared to the S4 structure, are consistent with
   experimental trends.},

   interaction with the Mn moment},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {With x-ray absorption spectroscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry
   we studied how the magnetic proximity effect at the interface between
   the cuprate high-T-C superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and the ferromagnet
   La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) is related to the electronic and magnetic
   properties of the LCMO layers. In particular, we explored how the
   magnitude of the ferromagnetic Cu moment on the YBCO side depends on the
   strength of the antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange coupling with the Mn
   moment on the LCMO side. We found that the Cu moment remains sizable if
   the AF coupling with the Mn moments is strongly reduced or even entirely
   suppressed. The ferromagnetic order of the Cu moments thus seems to be
   intrinsic to the interfacial CuO2 planes and related to a weakly
   ferromagnetic intraplanar exchange interaction. The latter is discussed
   in terms of the partial occupation of the Cu 3d(3z2)-r(2) orbitals,
   which occurs in the context of the so-called orbital reconstruction of
   the interfacial Cu ions.},

Abstract = {Structural properties of topological insulator bismuth telluride films
   grown epitaxially on (111) BaF2 with a fixed Bi2Te3 beam flux were
   systematically investigated as a function of substrate temperature and
   additional Te flux. A layer-by-layer growth mode is observed since the
   early stages of epitaxy and remains throughout the whole deposition.
   Composition of the epitaxial films produced here stays between Bi2Te3
   and Bi4Te5, as determined from the comparison of the measured x-ray
   diffraction curves with calculations. The substrate temperature region,
   where the growth rate remains constant, is found to be the most
   appropriate to obtain ordered Bi2Te3 films. Line width of the L = 18
   Bi2Te3 diffraction peaks as low as 140 arcsec was obtained, indicating
   high crystalline quality. Twinning domains density rises with increasing
   growth temperature and reducing Te extra flux. X-ray reflectivity curves
   of pure Bi2Te3 films with thickness from 165 to 8 nm exhibited well
   defined interference fringes, evidencing homogeneous layers with smooth
   surface. Our results demonstrate that Bi2Te3 films with very well
   controlled structural parameters can be obtained. High structural
   quality Bi2Te3 films as thin as only eight quintuple layers grown here
   are promising candidates for intrinsic topological insulator. Published

Title = {Constructing a magnetic handle for antiferromagnetic manganites},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},
Number = {14},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {An intrinsic property of antiferromagnetic materials is the compensation
   of the magnetic moments from the individual atoms that prohibits the
   direct interaction of the spin lattice with an external magnetic field.
   To overcome this limitation we have created artificial spin structures
   by heteroepitaxy between two bulk antiferromagnets SrMnO3 and NdMnO3.
   Here, we demonstrate that charge transfer at the interface results in
   the creation of thin ferromagnetic layers adjacent to A-type
   antiferromagnetism in thick NdMnO3 layers. A novel interference based
   neutron diffraction technique and polarized neutron reflectometry are
   used to confirm the presence of ferromagnetism in the SrMnO3 layers and
   to probe the relative alignment of antiferromagnetic spins induced by
   the coupling at the ferro-to antiferromagnet interface. A density
   functional theory analysis of the driving forces for the exchange
   reveals strong ferromagnetic interfacial coupling through quantifiable
   short range charge transfer. These results confirm a layer-by-layer
   control of magnetic arrangements that constitutes a promising step on a
   path towards isothermal magnetic control of antiferromagnetic
   arrangements as would be necessary in spin-based heterostructures like
   multiferroic devices.},

Abstract = {We report on a discrete layer-by-layer magnetic switching in Fe/MgO
   superlattices driven by an antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange
   coupling. The strong interlayer coupling is mediated by tunneling
   through MgO layers with thicknesses up to at least 1.8 nm, and the
   coupling strength varies with MgO thickness. Furthermore, the
   competition between the interlayer coupling and magnetocrystalline
   anisotropy stabilizes both 90 degrees and 180 degrees periodic alignment
   of adjacent layers throughout the entire superlattice. The tunable
   layer-by-layer switching, coupled with the giant tunneling
   magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe junctions, is an appealing combination
   for three-dimensional spintronic memories and logic devices.},

Abstract = {Here we report on the photocurrent response of two-dimensional (2D)
   heterostructures of sputtered MoS2 on boron nitride (BN) deposited on
   (001)-oriented Si substrates. The steady state photocurrent (I-ph)
   measurements used a continuous laser of lambda = 658 nm (E = 1.88 eV)
   over a broad range of laser intensities, P (similar to 1 mu W < P < 10
   mu W), and indicate that I-ph obtained from MoS2 layers with the 80 nm
   BN under layer was similar to 4 times higher than that obtained from
   MoS2 layers with the 30 nm BN under layer. We also found super linear
   dependence of I-ph on P (Iph proportional to P-gamma, with gamma > 1) in
   both the samples. The responsivities obtained over the range of laser
   intensity studied were in the order of mA/W (similar to 12 and similar
   to 2.7 mA/W with 80 nm BN and 30 nm BN under layers, respectively).
   These investigations provide crucial insight into the optical activity
   of MoS2 on BN, which could be useful for developing a variety of
   optoelectronic applications with MoS2 or other 2D transition metal
   dichalcogenide heterostructures.},

Abstract = {The strong interaction at an interface between a substrate and thin film
   leads to epitaxy and provides a means of inducing structural changes in
   the epitaxial film. These induced material phases often exhibit
   technologically relevant electronic, magnetic, and functional
   properties. The 2 x 1 surface of a Ge(001) substrate applies a unique
   type of epitaxial constraint on thin films of the perovskite oxide
   BaTiO3 where a change in bonding and symmetry at the interface leads to
   a non-bulk-like crystal structure of the BaTiO3. While the complex
   crystal structure is predicted using first-principles theory, it is
   further shown that the details of the structure are a consequence of
   hidden phases found in the bulk elastic response of the BaTiO3 induced
   by the symmetry of forces exerted by the germanium substrate.},

   structure and exchange coupling at (111)-oriented perovskite oxide
   interfaces. In the ultrathin limit (3-6 u.c.), we find that the
   antiferromagnetic (AF) properties of the LSFO sublayers are preserved
   with an out-of-plane canting of the AF spin axis, while the
   ferromagnetic (FM) properties of the LSMO sublayers are significantly
   depressed. For thicker LSFO layers (>9 u.c.), the out-of-plane canting
   of the AF spin axis is only present in superlattices with thick LSMO
   sublayers. As a result, exchange coupling in the form of spin-flop
   coupling exists only in superlattices which display both robust
   ferromagnetism and out-of-plane canting of the AF spin axis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {119},
Number = {6},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {We have studied the superconducting proximity effect in a series of
   e-beam evaporated Bi-Ni-Bi trilayers, where diffusion of Bi into Ni
   spontaneously formed superconducting NiBi3 layers at both Ni-Bi
   interfaces, effectively resulting in
   superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (S-F-S) trilayers. The
   thickness of top and bottom superconducting layers was found to be
   different with slightly different transition temperatures. Both
   resistive transition temperatures in the series of S-F-S trilayers
   showed 0-pi crossover as a function of ferromagnetic Ni thickness. The
   zero bias conductance calculated from the in-plane current-voltage
   measurements also confirmed the 0-pi crossovers. The possibility of
   proximity effect in the superconducting fluctuation regime, above
   transition temperature, was investigated via in-plane magneto-transport
   measurements at 4 K. We observed clear modulations in magneto-resistance
   (MR) and in low-field MR-hysteresis at 4 K, in contrast to their
   monotonic behavior at 10 K. Although the period of these modulations was
   commensurate with the observed periodicity of 0-pi crossovers, the
   nature of these modulations was found to be the same in both 0 and pi
   regimes. This observation suggested that in the superconducting
   fluctuation regime the apparent modulations of MR and MR-hysteresis were
   due to the variations in densities of superconducting fluctuations in
   individual NiBi3 layers, and not due to the proximity coupling between
   the superconducting layers. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Title = {A candidate Zr-doped Sb2Te alloy for phase change memory application},
Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {108},
Number = {5},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Here, Zr-doped Sb2Te alloy is proposed for phase change memory (PCM).
   Zr-doping enhances the crystallization temperature and thermal stability
   of Sb2Te alloy effectively. Crystalline Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) film is
   manifested as a single phase without phase separation and the growth of
   crystal grain is dramatically suppressed. The density change of
   Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) material between amorphous and crystalline is similar to
   2.65 +/- 0.03\%, which is much smaller than that of Ge2Sb2Te5 (6.5\%).
   Phase change memory cells based on Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) material can be
   reversibly switched by applying 40-400 ns width voltage pulses, and the
   reset current is relatively small when comparing with the prototypical
   Ge2Sb2Sb5 material. The resistance ON-OFF ratio of about 1.3 orders of
   magnitude is enough for figuring ``0{''} and ``1{''} out. Besides,
   endurance up to 4.1 x 10(4) cycles makes Zr-doped Sb2Te alloy a
   potential candidate for PCM. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Journal = {LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Neutron reflectometry offers a unique opportunity for the direct
   observation of nanostratification in He-3-He-4 mixtures in the ultra-low
   temperature limit. Unfortunately the results of recent experiments could
   not be well-modelled on account of a seemingly anomalous variation of
   reflectivity with momentum transfer. We now hypothesize that this effect
   is attributable to an optical distortion caused by the liquid's meniscus
   near the container wall. The validity of this idea is tested and
   confirmed through a subsidiary experiment on a D2O sample, showing that
   the meniscus can significantly distort results if the beam size in the
   horizontal plane is comparable with, or bigger than, the diameter of the
   container. The meniscus problem can be eliminated if the beam size is
   substantially smaller than the diameter of the container, such that
   reflection takes place only from the flat region of the liquid surface
   thus excluding the meniscus tails. Practical measures for minimizing the
   meniscus distortion effect are discussed. (C) 2016 Author(s).},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},
Number = {5},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The evolution of damping in Co/Pt, Co/Au, and Ni81Fe19/Pt bilayers was
   studied with increasing nonmagnetic (NM) heavy-metal layer thicknesses
   in the range 0.2 nm <= t(NM) <= 10 nm, where t(NM) is the NM layer
   thickness. Magnetization precession was measured in the time domain
   using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry. Fitting of
   the data with a damped sinusoidal function was undertaken in order to
   extract the phenomenological Gilbert damping coefficient a. For
   Pt-capped Co and Ni81Fe19 layers a large and complex dependence of a on
   the Pt layer thickness was observed, while for Au capping no significant
   dependence was observed. It is suggested that this difference is related
   to the different localized spin-orbit interaction related to intermixing
   and to alpha hybridization of Pt and Au at the interface with Co or
   Ni81Fe19. Also it was shown that damping is affected by the crystal
   structure differences in FM thin films and at the interface, which can
   modify the spin-diffusion length and the effective spin-mixing
   conductance. In addition to the intrinsic damping an extrinsic
   contribution plays an important role in the enhancement of damping when
   the Pt capping layer is discontinuous. The dependence of damping on the
   nonmagnetic layer thickness is complex but shows qualitative agreement
   with recent theoretical predictions.},

Abstract = {The large band gaps of existing contorted hexabenzocoronene derivatives
   severely limit visible-light absorption, restricting the photocurrents
   generated by solar cells utilizing contorted hexabenzocoronene (cHBC).
   To decrease the band gap and improve the light-harvesting properties, we
   synthesized cHBC derivatives having extended heterocyclic moieties as
   peripheral substituents. Tetrabenzofuranyldibenzocoronene (cTBFDBC) and
   tetrabenzothienodibenzocoronene (cTBTDBC) both exhibit broader
   absorption of the solar spectrum compared to cHBC, with peak absorbances
   on the order of 10(5) cm(-1) in the near-ultraviolet and in the visible.
   Planar-heterojunction organic solar cells comprising cTBFDBC or cTBTDBC
   as the donor and C-70 as the acceptor surpass those having cHBC in
   photocurrent generation and power-conversion efficiency. Interestingly,
   devices containing cTBFDBC/C-70 exhibit the highest photocurrents
   despite cTBTDBC having the smallest band gap of the three cHBC
   derivatives. X-ray reflectivity of the active layers indicates a rougher
   donor-acceptor interface when cTBFDBC is employed instead of the other
   two donors. Consistent with this observation, internal quantum
   efficiency spectra suggest improved charge transfer at the donor
   acceptor interface when cTBFDBC-as opposed to cTBTDBC or cHBC-is used as
   the donor.},

   limited understanding of the link between composition and static and
   dynamic optical properties, despite the critical role these properties
   play in the design of light-harvesting devices. To clarify these
   relationships, we systemically studied the optoelectronic properties in
   La1-xSrxFeO3-delta epitaxial films, uncovering the effects of A-site
   cation substitution and oxygen stoichiometry. Variable-angle
   spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure static optical
   properties, revealing a linear increase in absorption coefficient at
   1.25 eV and a red-shifting of the optical absorption edge with
   increasing Sr fraction. The absorption spectra can be similarly tuned
   through the introduction of oxygen vacancies, indicating the critical
   role that nominal Fe valence plays in optical absorption. Dynamic
   optoelectronic properties were studied with ultrafast transient
   reflectance spectroscopy, revealing similar nanosecond photoexcited
   carrier lifetimes for oxygen deficient and stoichiometric films with the
   same nominal Fe valence. These results demonstrate that while the static
   optical absorption is strongly dependent on nominal Fe valence tuned
   through cation or anion stoichiometry, oxygen vacancies do not appear to
   play a significantly detrimental role in the recombination kinetics.},

Abstract = {This paper shows a study on the variation of the flow ratio between
   oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) in a hollow cathode arc
   discharge plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The
   thin films were analyzed using visible light spectroscopy, X-ray
   photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), and water
   vapor transmission rate (WVTR) measurements. The deposited samples were
   compared to a reactively sputtered SiO2 thin film. By increasing the
   oxygen to HMDSO flow ratio, the chemical, density, and optical
   properties of the coating approached those of the sputtered SiO2 film.
   However the permeation barrier of the SiO2 film only showed a slight
   improvement over that of the bare polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   substrate. The organic coating with high power and low oxygen flow,
   however, approached the barrier of the sputtered SiO2 thin film.},

Abstract = {X-ray and neutron reflectivity are two non destructive techniques which
   provide a wealth of information on thickness, structure and interracial
   properties in nanometer length scale. Combination of X-ray and neutron
   reflectivity is well suited for obtaining physical parameters of
   nanostructured thin films and superlattices. Neutrons provide a
   different contrast between the elements than X-rays and are also
   sensitive to the magnetization depth profile in thin films and
   superlattices. The real space information is extracted by fitting a
   model for the structure of the thin film sample in reflectometry
   experiments. We have applied a Genetic Algorithms technique to extract
   depth dependent structure and magnetic in thin film and multilayer
   systems by simultaneously fitting X-ray and neutron reflectivity data.},

Abstract = {P3HT:PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene):{[}6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid
   methyl ester) thin films are widely used as an active layer in organic
   solar cells. The influence of solvent (1,8-diiodooctane) was studied on
   electron density and topography of thin spin-coated P3HT:PCBM films. The
   structural properties were studied by grazing incidence X-ray
   diffraction technique. It was found that the crystallinity of the
   investigated films was significantly increased after solvent treatment.
   Using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) analysis, data from P3HT:PCBM/air and
   P3HT:PCBM/glass interfaces were collected and compared with a
   theoretical model. The electron density, film thickness, and interface
   roughness were determined with a few angstroms accuracy by simulating
   the XRR curves. The XRR data were then analyzed using a scheme based on
   the distorted-wave Born approximation. It was found that the addition of
   diiodooctane did not change the absorption coefficient but changed
   electron density and roughness. The XRR simulation results were in good
   agreement with the experimental results obtained from AFM measurements.},

Abstract = {The structure and morphology of mixed thin films of picene (C22H14, PIC)
   and perfluoropentacene (C22F14, PFP) as well as mixed thin films of PIC
   and pentacene (C22H14, PEN) grown by simultaneous coevaporation is
   investigated using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and
   near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. For both systems we find mixing
   on the molecular level and the formation of mixed structures. However,
   due to the strongly different interactions in both mixtures the ordering
   is fundamentally different. For the equimolar PFP:PIC mixtures, we
   observe the formation of two different mixed polymorphs with unit cells
   containing 2 PIC and 2 PFP molecules depending on the growth
   temperature. One of these polymorphs is a superlattice with in-plane
   compound segregation. The other polymorph is less symmetric and results
   only in a very short ranged in-plane ordering. In contrast, the PEN:PIC
   mixtures form crystals with unit cell parameters continuously changing
   with the molar concentrations between those of the pure compounds. The
   position of molecular species within the crystal lattice is statistical.
   Surprisingly, for higher concentrations of PIC we observe phase
   separation of surplus PIC molecules which corresponds to a limited
   intermixing of the two compounds. Finally, the results are discussed in
   the context of other organic semiconductor binary mixtures showing that
   besides chemical composition and steric compatibility the intramolecular
   arrangement of the atoms important for intermolecular interactions
   significantly influences the structure formation in organic
   semiconductor blends.},

Abstract = {Owing to its high room-temperature electron mobility and wide bandgap,
   BaSnO3 has recently become of significant interest for potential
   room-temperature oxide electronics. A hybrid molecular beam epitaxy
   (MBE) approach for the growth of high-quality BaSnO3 films is developed
   in this work. This approach employs hexamethylditin as a chemical
   precursor for tin, an effusion cell for barium, and a radio frequency
   plasma source for oxygen. BaSnO3 films were thus grown on SrTiO3 (001)
   and LaAlO3 (001) substrates. Growth conditions for stoichiometric BaSnO3
   were identified. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
   intensity oscillations, characteristic of a layer-by-layer growth mode
   were observed. A critical thickness of similar to 1 nm for strain
   relaxation was determined for films grown on SrTiO3 using in situ RHEED.
   Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron
   energy-loss spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
   confirmed the cube-on-cube epitaxy and composition. The importance of
   precursor chemistry is discussed in the context of the MBE growth of
   BaSnO3. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.},

Abstract = {Small-molecule organic photovoltaic cells often employ a planar
   heterojunction (PHJ) geometry where the electron donor and acceptor
   materials are stacked one on top of the other. The thin-film growth
   scenario of such PHJs can be very different from the one of a single
   compound on a bare substrate. We have investigated the growth of PHJs,
   consisting of two different donor acceptor pairs, namely,
   alpha-serithiophene (6T)/C-60 and 6T/diindenoperylene (DIP) using
   real-time in situ X-ray scattering. For both donor acceptor material
   combinations, we observe that the coherent in-plane crystalline size of
   the second material strongly correlates with the one of the bottom one,
   and hence a strong templating effect of the 6T on the material deposited
   subsequently, indicating a strong interaction between the two materials
   in the PHJ. Furthermore, a change in the structure of the 6T film during
   the deposition of the second material was observed, which shows that the
   deposition of an additional material on top of a templating layer can
   partially change the crystal structure of the templating film itself.},

Abstract = {Raman measurements of a Fano-type surface phonon mode associated with
   Dirac surface states (SS) in Bi2Se3 topological insulator thin films
   allowed an unambiguous determination of the electron-phonon coupling
   strength in Dirac SS as a function of film thickness ranging from 2 to
   40 nm. A non-monotonic enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling
   strength with maximum for the 8-10 nm thick films was observed. The
   non-monotonicity is suggested to originate from plasmon-phonon coupling
   which enhances electron-phonon coupling when free carrier density in
   Dirac SS increases with decreasing film thickness and becomes suppressed
   for thinnest films when anharmonic coupling between in-plane and
   out-of-plane phonon modes occurs. The observed about four-fold
   enhancement of electron-phonon coupling in Dirac SS of the 8-10 nm thick
   Bi2Se3 films with respect to the bulk samples may provide new insights
   into the origin of superconductivity in this-type materials and their
   applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

   Theory for a jellium model. This behavior is similar to those observed
   in other transition metals such as Cu, Ag and Au, but different from the
   linear dependence recently observed in another transition metal, Pd,
   which belongs to the same Group of Pt in the Periodic Table. These
   differences are analyzed in term of the properties of the electronic
   bands corresponding to Pt and Pd, represented in terms of the
   corresponding density of states. The present experiments include also a
   detailed study of the angular dependence of the energy loss and the
   angular distributions of transmitted protons and deuterons. The results
   are compared with computer simulations based on the Monte Carlo method
   and with a theoretical model that evaluates the contributions of elastic
   collisions, path length effects in the inelastic energy losses, and the
   effects of the foil roughness. The results of the analysis obtained from
   these various approaches provide a consistent and comprehensive
   description of the experimental findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Magnetic materials without structural inversion symmetry can display the
   Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which manifests itself as chiral
   magnetic ground states. These chiral states can interact in complex ways
   with applied fields and boundary conditions provided by finite sample
   sizes that are of the order of the length scale of the chiral states.
   Here we study epitaxial thin films of FeGe with a thickness close to the
   helix pitch of the helimagnetic ground state, which is about 70 nm, by
   conventional magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry. We show
   that the helix in an FeGe film reverses under the application of a field
   by deforming into a helicoidal form, with twists in the helicoid being
   forced out of the film surfaces on the way to saturation. An additional
   boundary condition was imposed by exchange-coupling a ferromagnetic Fe
   layer to one of the interfaces of an FeGe layer. This forces the FeGe
   spins at the interface to point in the same direction as the Fe,
   preventing node expulsion and giving a handle by which the reversal of
   the helical magnet may be controlled.},

Abstract = {This work explores resistive switching mechanisms in non-volatile
   organic memory devices based on tris(8-hydroxyquinolie) aluminum
   (Alq(3)). Advanced characterization tools are applied to investigate
   metal diffusion in ITO/Alq(3)/Ag memory device stacks leading to
   conductive filament formation. The morphology of Alq(3)/Ag layers as a
   function of the metal evaporation conditions is studied by X-ray
   reflectivity, while depth profile analysis with X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is
   applied to characterize operational memory elements displaying reliable
   bistable current-voltage characteristics. 3D images of the distribution
   of silver inside the organic layer clearly point towards the existence
   of conductive filaments and allow for the identification of the initial
   filament formation and inactivation mechanisms during switching of the
   device. Initial filament formation is suggested to be driven by field
   assisted diffusion of silver from abundant structures formed during the
   top electrode evaporation, whereas thermochemical effects lead to local
   filament inactivation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

   show any signature of T-N. Our result clearly indicates the influence of

Abstract = {Enhancement of Gilbert damping in polycrystalline cobalt thin-film

   thicknesses above 6 nm is weakly dependent on cobalt thickness for both

   damping enhancement compared to copper overlayers, as expected due to
   spin pumping. The interfacial spin mixing conductance is significantly
   enhanced in structures where both cobalt and iridium have fcc(111)
   structure in comparison to those where the cobalt layer has subtly
   different hcp(0001) texture at the interface.},

Abstract = {The effects of Mn doping on the structural properties of the topological
   insulator Bi2Se3 in thin film form were studied in samples grown via
   molecular beam epitaxy. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure
   measurements, supported by density functional theory calculations,
   indicate that preferential incorporation occurs substitutionally in Bi
   sites across the entire film volume. This finding is consistent with
   x-ray diffraction measurements which show that the out of plane lattice
   constant expands while the in plane lattice constant contracts as the Mn
   concentration is increased. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates
   that the Mn valency is 2+ and that the Mn bonding is similar to that in
   MnSe. The expansion along the out of plane direction is most likely due
   to weakening of the Van der Waals interactions between adjacent Se
   planes. Transport measurements are consistent with this Mn 2+
   substitution of Bi sites if additional structural defects induced by
   this substitution are taken into account. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {Here we study the effect of La-doping in EuO thin films using
   superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, muon spin
   rotation (mu SR), polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR), and density
   functional theory (DFT). The mu SR data shows that the La0.15Eu0.85O is
   homogeneously magnetically ordered up to its elevated T-C. It is
   concluded that bound magnetic polaron behavior does not explain the
   increase in T-C and an Ruderman-KittelKasuya-Yosida-like (RKKY-like)
   interaction is consistent with the mu SR data. The estimation of the
   magnetic moment by DFT simulations concurs with the results obtained by
   PNR, showing a reduction of the magnetic moment per LaxEu1-xO for
   increasing lanthanum doping. This reduction of the magnetic moment is
   explained by the reduction of the number of Eu-4f electrons present in
   all the magnetic interactions in EuO films. Finally, we show that an
   upwards shift of the Fermi energy with La or Gd doping gives rise to
   half-metallicity for doping levels as high as 3.2\%.},

Abstract = {BaSnO3 has recently been identified as a high mobility wide gap
   semiconductor with significant potential for room temperature oxide
   electronics. Here, a detailed study of the high pressure oxygen
   sputter-deposition, microstructure, morphology, and stoichiometry of
   epitaxial BaSnO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) is reported, optimized
   conditions resulting in single-phase, relaxed, close to stoichiometric
   films. Most significantly, vacuum annealing is established as a facile
   route to n-doped BaSnO3-delta, leading to electron densities above
   10(19) cm(-3), 5 m Omega cm resistivities, and room temperature mobility
   of 20 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in 300-angstrom-thick films on MgO(001). Mobility
   limiting factors, and the substantial scope for their improvement, are
   discussed. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article content, except where

Abstract = {Topological insulator (TI) thin films of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 have been
   successfully grown on amorphous fused silica (vitreous SiO2) substrates
   by molecular beam epitaxy. We find that such growth is possible and
   investigations by X-ray diffraction reveal good crystalline quality with
   a high degree of order along the c-axis. Atomic force microscopy,
   electron backscatter diffraction and X-ray reflectivity are used to
   study the surface morphology and structural film parameters.
   Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies confirm the existence
   of a topological surface state. This work shows that TI films can be
   grown on amorphous substrates, while maintaining the topological surface
   state despite the lack of in-plane rotational order of the domains. The
   growth on fused silica presents a promising route to detailed
   thermoelectric measurements of TI films, free from unwanted thermal,
   electrical, and piezoelectric influences from the substrate. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Water uptake and swelling in a thin (similar to 15 nm) Nafion film on
   SiO2 native oxide on a Si wafer is studied as a function of relative
   humidity (8-97\%) at room temperature and as a function of temperature
   (25-60 degrees C) at 97\% relative humidity by neutron reflectometry.
   This is the first report on the behavior of thin Nafion films at
   elevated temperatures and high humidity. Large hysteresis is observed
   during the temperature cycle. The observed swelling strain in the film
   at 60 degrees C is 48\% as compared to the as-deposited state, which is
   far above any previously observed trend at room temperature. A small
   decrease in the average SLD suggests that part of the additional
   swelling is due to thermal expansion, but the estimated D2O/SO3 ratio
   also increases by 70\%. Half of the ``excess{''} absorption and 73\% of
   the additional swelling are retained during cooling back to room
   temperature. The results provide new insights into the dynamics of
   Nafion on nanometer scales under fuel cell operating conditions.},

Abstract = {Two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at the interfaces of oxide
   heterostructures draw considerable interest owing to their unique

   Structural analysis confirms the epitaxial growth of heterostructures
   with abrupt interfaces and a high degree of crystallinity. Transport
   measurements show the conduction to be an interface effect, similar to 9
   x 10(13) cm(-2) electrons per interface. Good agreement is demonstrated
   between the electronic behavior of structures grown on Si and on an

Abstract = {Zirconium nitride (ZrN) has the lowest bulk electrical resistivity and
   high thermal stability among group IV and V transition metal nitrides,
   which makes it a promising material for ULSI applications such as a

   enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) of conducting ZrN thin films
   using Zr{[}N(CH3)(2)](4) and forming gas (5\% H-2 + 95\% N-2) plasma is
   reported in this article. The growth per cycle (GPC) for every
   deposition was determined from analysis of dynamic in-situ spectroscopic
   ellipsometry (d-iSE) measurements. An experimental design is proposed
   for faster determination of ALD growth saturation curves. At substrate
   temperature of 150 degrees C, a GPC of 0.10 nm/cycle was observed for
   self-limiting ZrN PEALD growth. The electrical resistivity of ZrN films
   deposited on SiO2 substrate was found to be 559.5 +/- 18.5 mu Omega cm
   with negligible change in resistivity even after similar to 1000 h
   exposure to air. The metallic behavior of our ZrN films was evident from
   the free electron dispersion component in dielectric response, the broad

Abstract = {Phase-change memory (PCM) has great potential for numerous attractive
   applications on the premise of its high-device performances, which still
   need to be improved by employing a material with good overall
   phase-change properties. In respect to fast speed and high endurance,
   the Ti-Sb-Te alloy seems to be a promising candidate. Here, Ti-doped
   Sb2Te3 (TST) materials with different Ti concentrations have been
   systematically studied with the goal of finding the most suitable
   composition for PCM applications. The thermal stability of TST is
   improved dramatically with increasing Ti content. The small density
   change of T0.32Sb2Te3 (2.24\%), further reduced to 1.37\% for
   T0.56Sb2Te3, would greatly avoid the voids generated at phase-change
   layer/electrode interface in a PCM device. Meanwhile, the exponentially
   diminished grain size (from similar to 200 nm to similar to 12 nm),
   resulting from doping more and more Ti, enhances the adhesion between
   phase-change film and substrate. Tests of TST-based PCM cells have
   demonstrated a fast switching rate of similar to 10 ns. Furthermore,
   because of the lower thermal conductivities of TST materials, compared
   with Sb2Te3-based PCM cells, T0.32Sb2Te3-based ones exhibit lower
   required pulse voltages for Reset operation, which largely decreases by
   similar to 50\% for T0.43Sb2Te3-based ones. Nevertheless, the operation
   voltages for T0.56Sb2Te3-based cells dramatically increase, which may be
   due to the phase separation after doping excessive Ti. Finally,
   considering the decreased resistance ratio, TixSb2Te3 alloy with x
   around 0.43 is proved to be a highly promising candidate for fast and
   long-life PCM applications.},

Abstract = {Chemically ordered B2 FeRh exhibits a remarkable
   antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition that is first order. It
   thus shows phase coexistence, usually by proceeding though nucleation at
   random defect sites followed by propagation of phase boundary domain
   walls. The transition occurs at a temperature that can be varied by
   doping other metals onto the Rh site. We have taken advantage of this to
   yield control over the transition process by preparing an epilayer with
   oppositely directed doping gradients of Pd and Ir throughout its height,
   yielding a gradual transition that occurs between 350 K and 500 K. As
   the sample is heated, a horizontal antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase
   boundary domain wall moves gradually up through the layer, its position
   controlled by the temperature. This mobile magnetic domain wall affects
   the magnetisation and resistivity of the layer in a way that can be
   controlled, and hence exploited, for novel device applications. (C) 2015

Title = {Influence of ibuprofen on phospholipid membranes},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},

Volume = {91},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {A basic understanding of biological membranes is of paramount importance
   as these membranes comprise the very building blocks of life itself.
   Cells depend in their function on a range of properties of the membrane,
   which are important for the stability and function of the cell,
   information and nutrient transport, waste disposal, and finally the
   admission of drugs into the cell and also the deflection of bacteria and
   viruses. We have investigated the influence of ibuprofen on the
   structure and dynamics of L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (SoyPC) membranes
   by means of grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering, neutron
   reflectometry, and grazing incidence neutron spin echo spectroscopy.
   From the results of these experiments, we were able to determine that
   ibuprofen induces a two-step structuring behavior in the SoyPC films,
   where the structure evolves from the purely lamellar phase for pure
   SoyPC over a superposition of two hexagonal phases to a purely hexagonal
   phase at high concentrations. A relaxation, which is visible when no
   ibuprofen is present in the membrane, vanishes upon addition of
   ibuprofen. This we attribute to a stiffening of the membrane. This
   behavior may be instrumental in explaining the toxic behavior of
   ibuprofen in long-term application.},

Abstract = {Bulk crystals and thin films of PbTi1-xFexO3-delta ( PTFO) are
   multiferroic, exhibiting ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at room
   temperature. Here we report that the Ruddlesden-Popper phase
   Pbn+1(Ti1-xFex)(n)O3n+1-delta forms spontaneously during pulsed laser
   deposition of PTFO on LaAlO3 substrates. High-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoemission
   spectroscopy were utilised to perform a structural and compositional
   analysis, demonstrating that n similar or equal to 8 and x similar or
   equal to 0.5. The complex dielectric function of the films was
   determined from far-infrared to ultraviolet energies using a combination
   of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, Fourier transform spectroscopy,
   and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The simultaneous Raman and infrared
   activity of phonon modes and the observation of second harmonic
   generation establishes a non-centrosymmetric point group for
   Pbn+1(Ti1-xFex)(n)O3n+1-delta, a prerequisite for (but not proof of)
   ferroelectricity. No evidence of macroscopic ferromagnetism was found in
   SQUID magnetometry. The ultrafast optical response exhibited coherent
   magnon oscillations compatible with local magnetic order, and
   additionally was used to study photocarrier cooling on picosecond
   timescales. An optical gap smaller than that of BiFeO3 and long
   photocarrier lifetimes may make this system interesting as a
   ferroelectric photovoltaic.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2015},

Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to substantially modify
   orbital occupations and symmetries in electronically correlated oxides.
   In contrast to methods using strain or confinement, this orbital tuning
   is achieved by exploiting charge transfer and inversion symmetry
   breaking using atomically layered heterostructures. We illustrate the
   technique in the LaTiO3-LaNiO3-LaAlO3 system; a combination of x-ray
   absorption spectroscopy and ab initio theory reveals electron transfer
   and concomitant polar fields, resulting in a similar to 50\% change in
   the occupation of Ni d orbitals. This change is sufficiently large to
   remove the orbital degeneracy of bulk LaNiO3 and creates an electronic
   configuration approaching a single-band Fermi surface. Furthermore, we
   theoretically show that such three-component heterostructuring is robust
   and tunable by choice of insulator in the heterostructure, providing a
   general method for engineering orbital configurations and designing
   novel electronic systems.},

Journal = {FARADAY DISCUSSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {301-311},
Abstract = {X-ray diffraction has been used to probe the radiolytic corrosion of
   uranium dioxide. Single crystal thin films of UO2 were exposed to an
   intense X-ray beam at a synchrotron source in the presence of water, in
   order to simultaneously provide radiation fields required to split the
   water into highly oxidising radiolytic products, and to probe the
   crystal structure and composition of the UO2 layer, and the morphology
   of the UO2/water interface. By modeling the electron density, surface
   roughness and layer thickness, we have been able to reproduce the
   observed reflectivity and diffraction profiles and detect changes in
   oxide composition and rate of dissolution at the Angstrom level, over a
   timescale of several minutes. A finite element calculation of the highly
   oxidising hydrogen peroxide product suggests that a more complex surface
   interaction than simple reaction with H2O2 is responsible for an
   enhancement in the corrosion rate directly at the interface of water and
   UO2, and this may impact on models of long-term storage of spent nuclear
   fuel.},

Volume = {105},
Number = {23},

Abstract = {Neutron and X-ray reflectometry were used to determine the layer
   structure and hydrogen content of thin films of amorphous silicon
   (a-Si:H) deposited onto crystalline silicon (Si) wafers for surface
   passivation in solar cells. The combination of these two reflectometry
   techniques is well suited for non-destructive probing of the structure
   of a-Si:H due to being able to probe buried interfaces and having
   sub-nanometer resolution. Neutron reflectometry is also unique in its
   ability to allow determination of density gradients of light elements
   such as hydrogen (H). The neutron scattering contrast between Si and H
   is strong, making it possible to determine the H concentration in the
   deposited a-Si:H. In order to correlate the surface passivation
   properties supplied by the a-Si:H thin films, as quantified by
   obtainable effective minority carrier lifetime, photoconductance
   measurements were also performed. It is shown that the minority carrier
   lifetime falls sharply when H has been desorbed from a-Si:H by
   annealing. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Control of atomic structure, namely the topology of the corner-connected
   metal-oxygen octahedra, has emerged as an important route to tune the
   functional properties at oxide interfaces. Here we investigate isovalent
   manganite superlattices (SLs), {[}(La0.7Sr0.3MnO3) n/(Eu0.7Sr0.3MnO3) n]
   x m, as a route to spatial control over electronic bandwidth and
   ferromagnetism through the creation of octahedral superstructures.
   Electron energy loss spectroscopy confirms a uniform Mn valence state
   throughout the SLs. In contrast, the presence of modulations of the MnO6
   octahedral rotations along the growth direction commensurate with the SL
   period is revealed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and
   X-ray diffraction. We show that the Curie temperatures of the
   constituent materials can be systematically engineered via the
   octahedral superstructures leading to a modulated magnetization in
   samples where the SL period is larger than the interfacial octahedral
   coupling length scale, whereas a single magnetic transition is observed
   in the short-period SLs.},

   measurements demonstrate a good crystalline structure which is retained
   upon doping up to similar to 7.5 atomic-\% Mn, determined by Rutherford
   back-scattering spectrometry (RBS), and show no evidence of the
   formation of parasitic phases. However an increasing interstitial
   incorporation of Mn is observed with increasing doping concentration. A
   magnetic moment of 5.1 mu(B)/Mn is obtained from bulk-sensitive SQUID
   measurements, and a much lower moment of 1.6 mu(B)/Mn from
   surface-sensitive XMCD. At similar to 2.5 K, XMCD at the Mn L-2,L-3
   edge, reveals short-range magnetic order in the films and indicates

Abstract = {Using x-ray photoelectron emission microscopy we have observed the
   coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases in a (3 at\%)

   we observe that as the epilayer transforms there is a change in magnetic
   domain symmetry from predominantly twofold at lower temperatures through
   to an equally weighted combination of both four and twofold symmetries
   at higher temperature. It is postulated that the lowered symmetry
   Ising-like nematic phase resides at the near-surface of the epilayer.
   This behavior is different to that of undoped FeRh suggesting that the
   variation in symmetry is driven by the competing structural and
   electronic interactions in the nanoscale FeRh film coupled with the
   effect of the chemical doping disorder.},

Title = {Effect of Surface Termination on the Electronic Properties of LaNiO3
   Films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {The electronic and structural properties of thin LaNiO3 films grown by
   using molecular beam epitaxy are studied as a function of the net ionic
   charge of the surface terminating layer. We demonstrate that electronic
   transport in nickelate heterostructures can be manipulated through
   changes in the surface termination due to a strong coupling of the
   surface electrostatic properties to the structural properties of the
   Ni-O bonds that govern electronic conduction. We observe experimentally
   and from first-principles theory an asymmetric response of the

   for films terminated with positively charged LaO planes. The ability to
   modify transport properties by the deposition of a single atomic layer
   can be used as a guiding principle for nanoscale device fabrication.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},

Abstract = {We report an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature (T-c)
   when the thickness (d) of the magnetic layer is decreased from 60 to 20
   angstrom in amorphous FeZr/AlZr multilayers. Further reduction of the
   thickness causes a decrease of T-c, as expected by finite-size scaling,
   while the magnetic moment decreases monotonically for all values of d.
   The increase of the critical temperature is attributed to a reversed
   interface effect where local changes in the nearest-neighbor distance
   and coordination number gives a higher effective magnetic coupling at
   the interfaces compared to the interior of the layer. We have
   successfully described the results within a model where such interface
   effects are combined with finite-size scaling.},

Abstract = {Nanoconfined magnesium hydride can be simultaneously protected and
   thermodynamically destabilized when interfaced with materials such as Ti
   and Fe. We study the hydrogenation of thin layers of Mg (<14 nm)
   nanoconfined in one dimension within thin film Fe/Mg/Fe/Pd multilayers
   by the optical technique Hydrogenography. The hydrogenation of nanosized
   magnesium layers in Fe/Mg/Fe multilayers surprisingly shows the presence
   of multiple plateau pressures, whose nature is thickness dependent. In
   contrast, hydrogen desorption occurs via a single plateau which does not
   depend on the Mg layer thickness. From structural and morphological
   analyses with X-ray diffraction/reflectometry and cross-section TEM, we
   find that the Mg layer roughness is large when deposited on Fe and
   furthermore contains high-angle grain boundaries (GB's). When grown on
   Ti, the Mg layer roughness is low and no high-angle GB's are detected.
   From a Ti/Mg/Fe multilayer, in which the Mg layer is flat and has little
   or no GB's, we conclude that MgH2 is indeed destabilized by the
   interface with Fe. In this case, both the ab- and desorption plateau
   pressures are increased by a factor two compared to the hydrogenation of
   Mg within Ti/Mg/Ti multilayers. We hypothesize that the GB's in the
   Fe/Mg/Fe multilayer act as diffusion pathways for Pd, which is known to
   greatly alter the hydrogenation behavior of Mg when the two materials
   share an interface. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},
Number = {12},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {The contact between a molecule and a metallic electrode contributes to
   or even determines the characteristics of organic devices, such as their
   electronic properties. This is partly due to the charge transfer that
   takes place when two materials with different chemical potentials are
   put together. In the case of magnetic electrodes, the transfer can be
   accompanied by the transmission of a net spin polarization or spin
   doping. In nanocarbon systems, hybridization and spin doping can
   suppress the moment of a transition metal ferromagnet through the loss
   of majority spin electrons to the organic. Here, C-60 is shown to become
   ferromagnetic as a result of spin doping from cobalt with an induced
   moment of 1.2 mu(B) per cage while suppressing the moment of the
   ferromagnet by up to 21\%. Polarized neutron reflectivity and x-ray
   magnetic circular dichroism reveal the presence of an antiferromagnetic
   coupling of the interfacial layers of cobalt and C-60, and weakly
   coupled induced magnetism propagating into the bulk organic. Thus, it is
   shown that the deposition of molecules with high electron affinity can
   be used to induce zero-voltage spin injection.},

Abstract = {Measuring the magnetic configuration at complex buried layers and

   (XRMR) combines the non-destructive depth profiling potential of x-ray

   utilizing the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism effect. It provides the
   magnetic spatial distribution with a precision down to the angstrom
   scale, combined with element and symmetry specificity, sub-monolayer
   sensitivity, and the possible separation of spin and orbital magnetic
   moments. This review provides an overview to the XRMR technique in a
   tutorial way. We focus on the introduction to the theory, measurement
   types, and data simulation. We provide related experimental examples and

Abstract = {The element-specific magnetization and ordering in trilayers consisting
   of 0.3-1.4 monolayer (ML) thick Fe layers embedded in Pd(001) has been
   determined using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering. The proximity to Fe
   induces a large moment in the Pd which extends similar to 2 nm from the
   interfaces. The magnetization as a function of temperature is found to
   differ significantly for the Fe and Pd sublattices: The Pd signal
   resembles the results obtained by magneto-optical techniques with an
   apparent three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) transition in
   spatial dimensionality for Fe thickness below similar to 1 ML. In stark
   contrast, the Fe data exhibits a 2D behavior. No ferromagnetic signal is
   obtained from Fe below the 2D percolation limit in Fe coverage (similar
   to 0.7 ML), while Pd shows a ferromagnetic response for all samples. The
   results are attributed to the temperature dependence of the
   susceptibility of Pd and a profound local anisotropy of submonolayered
   Fe.},

Abstract = {The electronic phase diagram of epitaxial La1-xSrxFeO3 films is

   0.49-0.9 as revealed by temperature-dependent resistivity measurements.
   The transition temperatures are found to decrease with increasing Sr

Abstract = {We report on the electronic transport properties of epitaxial
   La1/3Sr2/3FeO3 films using temperature dependent resistivity, Hall
   effect, and magnetoresistance measurements. We show that the electronic
   phase transition, which occurs near 190 K, results in a change in
   conduction mechanism from nonadiabatic polaron transport at high
   temperatures to resistivity behavior following a power law temperature
   dependence at low temperatures. The phase transition is also accompanied
   by an abrupt increase in apparent mobility and Hall coefficient below
   the critical temperature (T{*}). We argue that the exotic low
   temperature transport properties are a consequence of the unusually
   long-range periodicity of the antiferromagnetic ordering, which also
   couples to the electronic transport in the form of a negative
   magnetoresistance below T{*} and a sign reversal of the Hall coefficient
   at T{*}. By comparing films of differing thicknesses, stoichiometry, and
   strain states, we demonstrate that the observed conduction behavior is a
   robust feature of La1/3Sr2/3FeO3. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {We investigate the growth of ZnS nanoparticles by a real-time
   simultaneous small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS) study
   using synchrotron radiation. Zinc chloride and elemental sulfur were
   dissolved in oleylamine. The formation of nanoparticles was induced by
   heating to 170 degrees C and 215 degrees C. The influence of
   temperature, reaction time, and sulfur concentration was investigated.
   After a short phase of rapid growth, saturation in size and a slower
   growth is observed depending on the temperature. The final size of the
   nanoparticles ranges between 2 and 6 nm for the investigated growth
   conditions and increases with the reaction temperature and sulfur
   concentration. SAXS analysis allows for determination of the size of the
   nanoparticles and proves also the existence of an organized layer of
   oleylamine molecules covering the nanoparticles' surfaces, which,
   however, appears only for diameters of the nanoparticles larger than
   approximately 2.8 nm. The investigation of the measured structure factor
   of the nanoparticle assemblies showed that the distance of an attractive
   interaction is 2.5 nm, which was interpreted as a consequence of the
   ordered oleylamine surface layer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   high crystalline quality. While the first LSCO layer remains clamped to
   the LaSrAlO4 substrate, a sizable strain relaxation occurs already in
   the first LCMO layer. The following LSCO and LCMO layers adopt a nearly
   balanced state in which the tensile and compressive strain effects yield
   alternating in-plane lattice parameters with an almost constant average
   value. No major defects are observed in the LSCO layers, while a
   significant number of vertical antiphase boundaries are found in the
   LCMOlayers. The LSCO layers remain superconducting with a relatively
   high superconducting onset temperature of T onset c approximate to 36 K.
   The macroscopic superconducting response is also evident in the
   magnetization data due to a weak diamagnetic signal below 10 K for H
   parallel to ab and a sizable paramagnetic shift for H parallel to c that
   can be explained in terms of a vortex-pinning-induced flux compression.
   The LCMO layers maintain a strongly ferromagnetic state with a Curie
   temperature of T Curie approximate to 190 K and a large low-temperature
   saturation moment of about 3.5(1) mu(B) per Mn ion. These results
   suggest that the LSCO/ LCMO superlattices can be used to study the
   interaction between the antagonistic ferromagnetic and superconducting
   orders and, in combination with previous studies on YBa2Cu3O7-x/ La2/
   3Ca1/ 3MnO3 superlattices, may allow one to identify the relevant
   mechanisms.},

   real-time during growth},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {139},

Abstract = {We discuss the result of the competing effects of favourable
   intermolecular interactions and steric incompatibilities due to the size
   mismatch of perfluoropentacene (PFP) and diindenoperylene (DIP) on the
   structure formation and associated optical properties in mixed films.
   Using real-time grazing incidence X-ray diffraction we investigate the
   size of coherently scattering islands l(s) as a function of film
   thickness and mixing ratio. We find that for PFP: DIP 1: 2 blends l(s)
   is by a factor of similar to 4 smaller than in pure DIP films, while
   l(s) of the PFP: DIP 2: 1 blends is not significantly reduced compared
   with pure PFP. Yet, we observe an increase in l(s) with film thickness
   for all of the samples, independent on the mixing ratio. In parallel
   with the structural characterization we investigate the evolution of the
   absorption spectra in the visible spectral range and its dependence on
   l(s) in situ during film growth using differential reflectance
   spectroscopy. We observe a surprisingly strong effect of changes in the
   structural order on the shape of epsilon(2, xy)(E), evident by a
   pronounced evolution of characteristic peaks in the thickness range from
   1.6 nm to 9.6 nm. The combined results of the real-time experiments
   allow to identify the thickness dependent crystal grain size as the
   origin of the observed transient effects in the absorption spectra. (C)

Title = {Sputter Growth and Characterization of Metamagnetic B2-ordered FeRh
   Epilayers},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2013},
Number = {80},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Chemically ordered alloys are useful in a variety of magnetic
   nanotechnologies. They are most conveniently prepared at an industrial
   scale using sputtering techniques. Here we describe a method for
   preparing epitaxial thin films of B2-ordered FeRh by sputter deposition
   onto single crystal MgO substrates. Deposition at a slow rate onto a
   heated substrate allows time for the adatoms to both settle into a
   lattice with a well-defined epitaxial relationship with the substrate
   and also to find their proper places in the Fe and Rh sublattices of the
   B2 structure. The structure is conveniently characterized with X-ray
   reflectometry and diffraction and can be visualised directly using
   transmission electron micrograph cross-sections. B2-ordered FeRh
   exhibits an unusual metamagnetic phase transition: the ground state is
   antiferromagnetic but the alloy transforms into a ferromagnet on heating
   with a typical transition temperature of about 380 K. This is
   accompanied by a 1\% volume expansion of the unit cell: isotropic in
   bulk, but laterally clamped in an epilayer. The presence of the
   antiferromagnetic ground state and the associated first order phase
   transition is very sensitive to the correct equiatomic stoichiometry and
   proper B2 ordering, and so is a convenient means to demonstrate the
   quality of the layers that can be deposited with this approach. We also
   give some examples of the various techniques by which the change in
   phase can be detected.},

Abstract = {NiFe(30 nm)/FeMn(13 nm)/NiFe(10 nm) heterostructures prepared by
   magnetron sputtering at different argon working pressures (0.27, 0.67
   and 1.33 Pa) were systematically investigated by using specular and
   off-specular diffuse X-ray scattering experiments, combined with
   ferromagnetic resonance technique, in order to distinguish the
   contribution from roughness and atomic diffusion to the total structural
   disorder at NiFe/FeMn interfaces. It was shown that an increase in the
   working gas pressure from 0.27 to 1.33 Pa causes an enhancement of the
   atomic diffusion at the NiFe/FeMn interfaces, an effect more pronounced
   at the top FeMn/NiFe interface. In particular, this atomic diffusion
   provokes a formation of non-uniform magnetic dead-layers at the
   NiFe/FeMn interfaces (NiFeMn regions with paramagnetic or weak
   antiferromagnetic properties); that are responsible for the substantial
   reduction of the exchange bias field in the NiFe/FeMn system. Thus, this
   work generically helps to understand the discrepancies found in the
   literature regarding the influence of the interface broadening on the
   exchange bias properties (e.g., exchange bias field) of the NiFe/FeMn
   system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   for studies addressing the IEC, but the behavior in the weakly exchange
   coupled regime, complemented with the temperature dependence of the
   magnetic properties, have remained unexplored. We observe clear regions
   with ferro- and antiferromagnetic coupling, which is manifested in
   oscillations in the saturation field, the remanence and the critical
   temperature. The oscillation in the interlayer coupling (J') has a
   period of 5.8(1) ML. This is approximate to 0.8 ML smaller than observed
   for Fe(7)/V(x) superlattices which illustrates the influence of the
   magnetic layer thickness on the interlayer coupling. The temperature

Abstract = {Two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at the interface between two
   oxide band-insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 raises the possibility to
   develop oxide nanoelectronics. Here, we report the creation of a 2DEG at
   the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces grown by 90 degrees off-axis
   sputtering which allows uniform films over a large area. The electrical
   transport properties of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface are similar to
   those grown by pulsed laser deposition. We also demonstrate
   room-temperature conductive probe-based switching of
   quasi-one-dimensional structures. This work demonstrates that a scalable
   growth process can be used to create the two-dimensional electron gas
   system at oxide heterointerfaces. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {This Letter reports the impact of the evaporation rate on the

Title = {Depth profile of the ferromagnetic order in a YBa2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3
   superlattice on a LSAT substrate: A polarized neutron reflectometry
   study},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},

Abstract = {Using polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) we have investigated a
   {[}YBa2Cu3O7(10 nm)/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (9 nm)] 10 (YBCO/LCMO) superlattice
   grown by pulsed laser deposition on a La0.3Sr0.7Al0.65Ta0.35O3 (LSAT)
   substrate. Due to the high structural quality of the superlattice and
   the substrate, the specular reflectivity signal extends with a high
   signal-to-background ratio beyond the fourth-order superlattice Bragg
   peak. This allows us to obtain more detailed and reliable information
   about the magnetic depth profile than in previous PNR studies on similar
   superlattices that were partially impeded by problems related to the
   low-temperature structural transitions of the SrTiO3 substrates. In
   agreement with the previous reports, our PNR data reveal a strong
   magnetic proximity effect showing that the depth profile of the magnetic
   potential differs significantly from the one of the nuclear potential
   that is given by the YBCO and LCMO layer thickness. We present fits of
   the PNR data using different simple blocklike models for which either a
   large ferromagnetic moment is induced on the YBCO side of the interfaces
   or the ferromagnetic order is suppressed on the LCMO side. We show that
   a good agreement with the PNR data and with the average magnetization as
   obtained from dc magnetization data can only be obtained with the latter
   model where a so-called depleted layer with a strongly suppressed
   ferromagnetic moment develops on the LCMO side of the interfaces. We
   also show that the PNR data are still compatible with the presence of a
   small, ferromagnetic Cu moment of 0.25 mu(B) on the YBCO side that was
   previously identified with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray
   resonant magnetic reflectometry measurements on the same superlattice
   {[}D. K. Satapathy et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 197201 (2012)]. We
   discuss that the depleted layer thus should not be mistaken with a
   ``dead{''} layer that is entirely nonmagnetic but rather may contain a
   canted antiferromagnetic or an oscillatory type of ordering of the Mn
   moments that is not detected with the PNR technique. DOI:

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A new neutron reflectometer SuperADAM has recently been built and
   commissioned at the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France. It
   replaces the previous neutron reflectometer ADAM. The new instrument
   uses a solid state polarizer/wavelength filter providing a highly
   polarized (up to 98.6\%) monochromatic neutron flux of 8 x 10(4) n
   cm(-2) s(-1) with monochromatization Delta lambda/lambda = 0.7\% and
   angular divergence Delta alpha = 0.2 mrad. The instrument includes both
   single and position sensitive detectors. The position sensitive detector
   allows simultaneous measurement of specular reflection and off-specular
   scattering. Polarization analysis for both specular reflection and
   off-specular scattering is achieved using either mirror analyzers or a
   He-3 spin filter cell. High efficiency detectors, low background, and
   high flux provides a dynamic range of up to seven decades in
   reflectivity. Detailed specifications and the instrument capabilities
   are illustrated with examples of recently collected data in the fields
   of thin film magnetism and thin polymer films. (C) 2013 American

Pages = {4283-4290},
Abstract = {The ferroelectric and electro-optical properties of LiNbO3 make it an
   important material for current and future applications. It has also been
   suggested as a possible lead-free replacement for present PZT-devices.
   The atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique offers controlled deposition
   of films at an industrial scale and thus becomes an interesting tool for
   growth of LiNbO3. We here report on ALD deposition of LiNbO3 using
   lithium silylamide and niobium ethoxide as precursors, thereby providing
   good control of cation stoichiometry and films with low impurity levels
   of silicon. The deposited films are shown to be ferroelectric and their
   crystalline orientations can be guided by the choice of substrate. The
   films are polycrystalline on Si (100) as well as epitaxially oriented on
   substrates of Al2O3 (012), Al2O3 (001), and LaAlO3 (012). The coercive
   field of samples deposited on Si (100) was found to be similar to 220 kV
   cm(-1), with a remanent polarization of similar to 0.4 mu C cm(-2).
   Deposition of lithium containing materials is traditionally challenging
   by ALD, and critical issues with such deposition are discussed.},

Abstract = {Indium zinc oxide thin-film transistors are fabricated via a precursor
   in solution route on silicon substrates with silicon dioxide gate
   dielectric. It is found that the extracted mobility rises, peaks, and
   then decreases with increasing precursor concentration instead of rising
   and saturating. Investigation with scanning probe techniques reveals
   full thickness variations within the film which are assumed to adversely
   affect charge transport. Additional layers are coated, and the extracted
   mobility is observed to increase up to 19.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The reasons
   for this are examined in detail by direct imaging with scanning
   tunneling microscopy and extracting electron density profiles from X-ray
   reflection measurements. It is found that the optimal concentration for
   single layer films is suboptimal when coating multiple layers and in
   fact using many layers of very low concentrations of precursor in the
   solution, leading to a dense, defect and void free film, affording the
   highest mobilities. A consistent qualitative model of layer formation is
   developed explaining how the morphology of the film develops as the
   concentration of precursor in the initial solution is varied.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the magnetization profiles in superlattices
   composed of the two ferromagnets La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and SrRuO3 using
   spin-polarized neutron reflectometry. In combination with magnetometry,
   the neutron data indicate a noncollinear spin configuration where
   orientation of the Ru moments changes from in plane at the interface to
   out of plane deep inside the SrRuO3 layers. The spin structure
   originates in a competition between antiferromagnetic exchange
   interactions of Mn and Ru moments across the interface, and the
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the Ru moments, and it is closely
   related to the ``exchange spring{''} structures previously observed in
   multilayers composed of ferromagnetic elements and alloys.},

Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Exchange bias (EB) is induced by oxygen implantation in three different
   ferromagnetic materials: polycrystalline Co, highly textured Co and
   polycrystalline Ni. These systems are compared in order to study the
   influence of the grain boundary density and the intrinsic
   ferromagnet/antiferromagnet coupling strength on the
   implantation-induced EB. Special emphasis is given to the role of the
   implantation profile in the EB properties. The implantation profile is
   thoroughly characterized and its correlation with the magnetic depth
   profile, i.e. the magnetization as a function of depth, for different
   magnetic states is studied. This is achieved by modelling the implanted
   system as a layered system. In the three systems, the magnetization
   reversal mechanism is studied. In this way the effect of the
   implantation process on the reversal mechanism is unraveled.
   Irrespective of the particular system, the magnetization reverses solely
   by domain wall nucleation and motion, as opposed to Co/CoO bilayer
   systems, where a change in the reversal mechanism is observed upon the
   first reversal.},

Title = {Layering and temperature-dependent magnetization and anisotropy of
   naturally produced Ni/NiO multilayers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {112},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Ni/NiO multilayers were grown by magnetron sputtering at room
   temperature, with the aid of the natural oxidation procedure. That is,
   at the end of the deposition of each single Ni layer, air is let to flow
   into the vacuum chamber through a leak valve. Then, a very thin NiO
   layer (similar to 1.2 nm) is formed. Simulated x-ray reflectivity
   patterns reveal that layering is excellent for individual Ni-layer
   thickness larger than 2.5 nm, which is attributed to the intercalation
   of amorphous NiO between the polycrystalline Ni layers. The
   magnetization of the films, measured at temperatures 5-300 K, has almost
   bulk-like value, whereas the films exhibit a trend to perpendicular
   magnetic anisotropy (PMA) with an unusual significant positive interface
   anisotropy contribution, which presents a weak temperature dependence.
   The power-law behavior of the multilayers indicates a non-negligible
   contribution of higher order anisotropies in the uniaxial anisotropy.
   Bloch-law fittings for the temperature dependence of the magnetization
   in the spin-wave regime show that the magnetization in the multilayers
   decreases faster as a function of temperature than the one of bulk Ni.
   Finally, when the individual Ni-layer thickness decreases below 2 nm,
   the multilayer stacking vanishes, resulting in a dramatic decrease of
   the interface magnetic anisotropy and consequently in a decrease of the
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {Fe-Nb-B. thin-film metallic glasses (TFMGs) were synthesized via a

   may be attributed to the absence of a network-like structure based on

   The formation of solid solutions at the thin layer interfaces Au/Co and

   solutions was identified at annealing temperature of T-a = 750 K. The
   optical parameters of the samples were calculated using the genetic

Title = {Changes in magnetic properties of Co/Pd multilayers induced by hydrogen
   absorption},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The saturation magnetization (M-S) and perpendicular anisotropy energy
   (K-P) of Co/Pd multilayers were studied when the samples were exposed to
   1 atm of H-2 at room temperature. The samples had fixed Co nominal
   thicknesses of 2.5 angstrom and 4.5 angstrom and Pd thickness values
   ranging from 0 angstrom to 25 angstrom. The interface structure was
   determined from the x-ray scattering length density (SLD) profile. When
   the Pd thickness was less than 10 angstrom, there was a large amount of
   interface disorder which resulted in no change in M-S and K-P. As the Pd
   thickness increased, the SLD contrast between the Co and Pd layers also
   increased, leading to a decrease in M-S and K-P after H-2 absorption.
   This can be explained by a decrease in H-2 solubility as interface
   alloying became more dominant for thinner layers, which resulted from a
   smaller hydrogen electron transfer to the Pd 4d band. The changes in M-S
   and K-P in the less interdiffused samples also resulted from this
   electron transfer. Magnetic changes were reversible with characteristic
   absorption and desorption times of approximately 40 s for 1 atm of H-2.

Abstract = {Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of nanoscaled EuS thin films
   reveal a blue shift of the energy between the top-valence and
   bottom-conduction bands. This band-gap tuning changes smoothly with
   decreasing film thickness and becomes significant below the exciton Bohr
   diameter similar to 3.5 nm indicating strong quantum confinement
   effects. The results are reproduced in the framework of the potential
   morphing method in Hartree Fock approximation. The large values of the
   effective mass of the holes, due to localization of the EuS f-states,
   limit the blue shift to about 0.35 eV. This controllable band-gap tuning
   of magnetic semiconductor EuS renders it useful for merging spintronics

Abstract = {Thin films of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 have been deposited on
   single crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates using
   molecular beam epitaxy. Due to the large lattice mismatch,
   three-dimensional growth is observed with strain relaxation occurring
   within 1-2 unit cells. The as-grown perovskite/YSZ interfaces are
   abrupt, despite the imperfections associated with strain relaxation. The
   films exhibit a single crystallographic orientation along the growth
   direction, with the perovskite {[}011] parallel to the YSZ {[}001].
   Synchrotron diffraction and plan view transmission electron microscopy
   reveal the presence of a columnar grain structure with the in-plane
   {[}100] and {[}01 (1) over bar] film directions preferentially
   orientated along the YSZ < 100 >. The stabilization of perovskites on
   YSZ substrates with abrupt interfaces and a well-defined

   systems to study cathode/electrolyte interfacial reactions and
   morphological changes relevant to solid oxide fuel cells. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {In the current study, the structural characteristics of SiOx thin films
   grown by magnetron sputtering on Si substrates are reported. High
   resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of
   amorphous SiOx films for the as-deposited samples, as well as the ones
   annealed in ambient air for 30 min at 950 degrees C and of Si
   nanocrystals, embedded in amorphous SiOx, after Ar annealing for 1-4
   hours at 1000 degrees C. The nanocrystals, with sizes up to 6 nm,
   predominately exhibit \{111\} lattice planes. Energy-dispersive X-ray
   analysis showed that the Si/O ratio is between 0.5-1, i.e. the amorphous
   films comprise of a mixture of SiO2 and SiO. Phase images and
   corresponding strain maps created using Fourier filtering revealed a
   uniform contrast in the nanocrystals, which shows that the Si lattice
   constant does not vary significantly. The residual strain variations,
   around 4\%, may account for the possible existence of a small percentage
   of highly disordered Si or SiOx residual clusters inside the regular Si
   matrix, in full agreement with photoluminescence measurements performed

   using applied fields as large as 160 kOe to assure saturation of the
   entire sample, including magnetic moments that are normally pinned at
   lower fields. The locations of pinned and unpinned magnetization in the
   ferro-and antiferromagnets were identified. The origin of exchange bias
   in the RAF system is noticeably different than that of the DAF system.
   In the RAF system, a domain wall is formed at the RAF/F interface when
   the ferromagnet's magnetization is reversed. In the DAF system, some
   domains within the bulk of the DAF are reversed upon reversal of the
   ferromagnet while others remain pinned. In this case, the interface
   magnetization is entirely reversed.},

Abstract = {Differential evolution is a global optimization algorithm that has

   its proven effectiveness. In this article the performance of the
   algorithm is evaluated by fitting an X-ray reflectivity data set and
   investigating its convergence behavior as a function of its tuning
   parameters. The results offer important insights for applying
   differential evolution algorithms to scattering problems and provide
   some rules of thumb on how to tune the parameters. It is shown that, by
   choosing optimal tuning parameter values, the speed of the fitting
   process can be increased by an order of magnitude.},

Abstract = {Density, elastic modulus and the pair distribution function of
   Co-Fe-Ta-B metallic glasses were obtained by ab initio molecular
   dynamics simulations and measured for sputtered thin films using x-ray
   reflectivity, nanoindentation and x-ray diffraction using high energy

   the Young's moduli of 273 and 251 GPa, respectively, are consistent with
   our experiments and literature data. These data, together with the good
   agreement between the theoretical and the experimental pair distribution
   functions, indicate that the model established here is useful to
   describe the density, elasticity and short range order of Co-Fe-Ta-B
   metallic glass thin films. Irrespective of the investigated variation in
   chemical composition, (Co, Fe)-B cluster formation and Co-Fe
   interactions are identified by density-of-states analysis. Strong bonds
   within the structural units and between the metallic species may give

Abstract = {This work presents the influence of temperatures above 300 K on the
   crystal structure and morphology of pentacene thin films. The thermal
   expansion of the unit cell and the relative amount of different phases
   are investigated via grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. Geometrical
   considerations about the specific molecular packing of the thin-film
   phase explain the anisotropic non-linear expansion. Furthermore, around
   480 K, a phase transformation of the thin-film phase to the bulk phase
   is observed. In contrast, only a weak influence of the temperature on
   the height distribution of the thin-film phase crystallites is found.

   as the film thickness decreases. The maximum value observed for the
   thinnest film is very large, reaching a value of 1.2 eV. Such a shift
   was not easy to be observed in the past due to the very small Bohr

Title = {The Meissner effect in a strongly underdoped cuprate above its critical
   temperature},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Meissner effect and associated perfect `bulk' diamagnetism together
   with zero resistance and gap opening are characteristic features of the
   superconducting state. In the pseudogap state of cuprates, unusual
   diamagnetic signals and anomalous proximity effects have been detected,
   but a Meissner effect has never been observed. Here we probe the local
   diamagnetic response in the normal state of an underdoped
   La(1.94)Sr(0.06)CuO(4) layer (T'(c)less than or similar to 5 K), which
   is brought into close contact with two nearly optimally doped
   La(1.84)Sr(0.16)CuO(4) layers (T(c)approximate to 32 K). We show that
   the entire `barrier' layer of thickness, much larger than the typical c
   axis coherence lengths of cuprates, exhibits a Meissner effect at
   temperatures above T'(c) but below T(c). The temperature dependence of
   the effective penetration depth and superfluid density in different
   layers indicates that superfluidity with long-range phase coherence is
   induced in the underdoped layer by the proximity to optimally doped
   layers, but this induced order is sensitive to thermal excitation.},

Title = {Effects of hydrogen/deuterium absorption on the magnetic properties of
   Co/Pd multilayers},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {83},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {The effects of hydrogen (H-2) and deuterium (D-2) absorption were
   studied in two Co/Pd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
   (PMA) using polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR). PNR was measured in an
   external magnetic field H applied in the plane of the sample with the
   magnetization M confined in the plane for mu H-o = 6.0 T and partially
   out of plane at 0.65 T. Nominal thicknesses of the Co and Pd layers were
   2.5 and 21 angstrom, respectively. Because of these small values, the
   actual layer chemical composition, thickness, and interface roughness
   parameters were determined from the nuclear scattering length density
   profile (rho(n)) and its derivative obtained from both x-ray
   reflectivity and PNR, and uncertainties were determined using Monte
   Carlo analysis. The PNR rho(n) showed that although D2 absorption
   occurred throughout the samples, absorption in the multilayer stack was
   modest (0.02 D per Pd atom) and thus did not expand. Direct magnetometry
   showed that H-2 absorption decreased the total M at saturation and
   increased the component of M in the plane of the sample when not at
   saturation. The PNR magnetic scattering length density (rho(m)) revealed
   that the Pd layers in the multilayer stack were magnetized and that
   their magnetization was preferentially modified upon D-2 absorption. In
   one sample, a modulation of M with twice the multilayer period was
   observed at mu H-o = 0.65 T, which increased upon D-2 absorption. These
   results indicate that H-2 or D-2 absorption decreases both the PMA and
   total magnetization of the samples. The lack of measurable expansion
   during absorption indicates that these changes are primarily governed by
   modification of the electronic structure of the material.},

Abstract = {In this work, we present a simple method to fabricate high quality
   Ni/NiO multilayers with the use of a single magnetron sputtering head.
   Namely, at the end of the deposition of each single Ni layer, air is let
   to flow into the vacuum chamber through a leak valve. Then, a very thin
   NiO layer (similar to 1nm) is formed by natural oxidation. The process
   is reproducible and the result is the formation of a multilayer with
   excellent layering. Magnetization hysteresis loops recorded at 5 K and
   room temperature reveal a tendency for perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
   as the thickness of the individual Ni layers decreases. It is shown that
   the Ni/NiO interface has sizeable positive surface/interface anisotropy,
   i.e. it favors the development of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
   This is rather unusual for a Ni-based multilayered system and may render
   Ni/NiO multilayers useful for magneto-optical recording applications.},

Abstract = {For thin film devices based on coupling ferroelectric polarization to
   charge carriers in semiconductors, the role of the interface is
   critical. To elucidate this role, we use synchrotron x-ray diffraction
   to determine the interface structure of epitaxial SrTiO3 grown on the
   (001) surface of Si. The average displacement of the O octahedral
   sublattice relative to the Sr sublattice determines the film
   polarization and is measured to be about 0.05 nm toward the Si, with Ti
   off-center displacements 0.009 nm away from the substrate. Measurements
   of films with different boundary conditions on the top of the SrTiO3
   show that the polarization at the SrTiO3/Si interface is dominated by
   oxide-Si chemical interactions. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

   VDx, where the two-phase region displays hysteresis. The
   deuterium-induced volume expansion exhibits changes in slope that
   correlate with the plateau region and the expansion is comparable and

Abstract = {Surface modifications of glass slides employing the sterically hindered

   knowledge, this is the first time that a stable silanetriol has been
   directly used for this purpose. So far unprecedented, this process runs
   under neutral aqueous conditions and in the absence of organic solvents,
   which makes coating protocols accessible to acid-sensitive substrates.
   The layer thickness and surface topography are investigated by the
   Sarfus technique, by X-ray reflectivity, and by atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). These techniques yield values of 0.8 +/- 0.1 (XRR) and 0.6 +/-
   0.2 nm (Sarfus) for layer thickness and 0.33 nm for root mean square
   roughness (AFM). The modified surfaces have hydrophobic and oleophilic
   character and contact angles (CA) between 60 degrees (formamide, CH2I2)
   and 90 degrees (water) are obtained. The thin coatings allow a
   structuring by UV/ozone treatment in order to get hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic compartments on the surfaces. For all coatings, surface free
   energies are calculated using different models. To determine the
   isoelectric points (IEP) of the modified surfaces, we performed
   zeta-potential measurements. Correlations between zeta potentials and

   atomic-scale resolution. Here we review the in situ study of interfaces

   several examples of their application in electrochemical processes and

   present study we artificially engineer short-range order by depositing
   Pd-capped Mg/Ti multilayers with different periodicities.
   Notwithstanding the large lattice mismatch between Mg and Ti, the
   as-deposited metallic multilayers show good structural coherence. On
   exposure to H-2 gas a two-step hydrogenation process occurs with the Ti
   layers forming the hydride before Mg. From in situ measurements of the
   bilayer thickness Lambda at different hydrogen pressures, we observe
   large out-of-plane expansions of Mg and Ti layers on hydrogenation,
   indicating strong plastic deformations in the films and a consequent
   shortening of the coherence length. On unloading at room temperature in
   air, hydrogen atoms remain trapped in the Ti layers due to kinetic
   constraints. Such loading/unloading sequence can be explained in terms
   of the different thermodynamic properties of hydrogen in Mg and Ti, as
   shown by diffusion calculations on a model multilayered systems.
   Absorption isotherms measured by hydrogenography can be interpreted as a
   result of the elastic clamping arising from strongly bonded Mg/Pd and
   broken Mg/Ti interfaces.},

Abstract = {Ni/NiO multilayers with excellent sequencing are grown via
   radiofrequency magnetron sputtering with the use of one Ni target and
   natural oxidation. Ni layers consist of very small Ni nanocrystals
   interrupted by amorphous NiO layers. When Ni is deposited at 0.3 Pa
   Ar-pressure, the hard-magnetization axis is the film normal and
   saturation field decreases by decreasing Ni layer thickness.
   Considerable positive surface anisotropy is found, which is remarkable
   for Ni-based multilayers. If Ni is deposited at 3 Pa Ar-pressure,
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is observed at low temperatures even
   for 5.4 nm thick Ni layers. This anisotropy results in the formation of
   stripe magnetic domains. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:

Abstract = {We present a structural analysis of the graphene/Ru(0001) system

   Fourier-series-expanded displacement fields from an ideal bulk structure
   plus the application of symmetry constraints. The shape of the observed
   superstructure rods proves a reconstruction of the substrate, induced by
   strong bonding of graphene to ruthenium. Both the graphene layer and the
   underlying substrate are corrugated, with peak-to-peak heights of (0.82
   +/- 0.15)angstrom and (0.19 +/- 0.02)angstrom for graphene and the
   topmost Ru-atomic layer, respectively. The Ru corrugation decays slowly
   over several monolayers into the bulk. The system also exhibits
   chirality, whereby in-plane rotations of up to 2.0 degrees in those
   regions of the superstructure where the graphene is weakly bound are
   driven by elastic energy minimization.},

Abstract = {The influence of titanium and vanadium on the hydrogen transport rate
   through thin amorphous alumina films is addressed. Only small changes in
   the transport rate are observed when the Al2O3 are covered with titanium
   or vanadium. This is in stark contrast to results with a Pd overlayer,
   which enhances the transport by an order of magnitude. Similarly, when
   titanium is embedded into the alumina the transport rate is faster than
   for the covered case but still slower than the undoped reference.
   Embedding vanadium in the alumina does not yield an increase in uptake
   rate compared to the vanadium covered oxide layers. These results add to
   the understanding of the hydrogen uptake of oxidized metals, especially
   the alanates, where the addition of titanium has been found to
   significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen uptake. The current findings
   eliminate two possible routes for the catalysis of alanates by Ti,
   namely dissociation and effective diffusion short-cuts formed by Ti.
   Finally, no photocatalytic enhancement was noticed on the titanium
   covered samples. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Origin of the giant magnetic moment in epitaxial Fe3O4 thin films},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {81},
Number = {14},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {We study the enhanced magnetic moment observed in epitaxial magnetite
   (Fe3O4) ultrathin films (t < 15 nm) grown on MgO (001) substrates by
   means of pulsed laser deposition. The Fe3O4 (001) thin films exhibit
   high crystallinity, low roughness, and sharp interfaces with the
   substrate, and the existence of the Verwey transition at thicknesses
   down to 4 nm. The evolution of the Verwey transition temperature with
   film thickness shows a dependence with the antiphase boundaries density.
   Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and vibrating sample
   magnetometry measurements in ultrathin films show a magnetic moment much
   higher than the bulk magnetite value. In order to study the origin of
   this anomalous magnetic moment, polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR),
   and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) experiments have been
   performed, indicating a decrease in the magnetization with decreasing
   sample thickness. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements show no
   metallic Fe clusters present in the magnetite thin films. Through
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry
   measurements performed in commercial MgO (001) substrates, the presence
   of Fe impurities embedded within the substrates has been observed. Once
   the substrate contribution has been corrected, a decrease in the
   magnetic moment of magnetite thin films with decreasing thickness is
   found, in good agreement with the PNR and XMCD measurements. Our
   experiments suggest that the origin of the enhanced magnetic moment is
   not intrinsic to magnetite but due to the presence of Fe impurities in
   the MgO substrates.},

Abstract = {We present a multitechnique approach to study the detailed chemical and
   magnetic structure of uranium/gadolinium multilayers. At low temperature
   the saturation magnetization is found to be similar to 60\% of that of
   bulk gadolinium. We address this problem, which is found in many other
   multilayers and suggest a model that may have wider applications.
   transmission electron microscopy images indicate a microstructure,
   consistent with a columnar growth of Gd with crystallites of the order
   20 -> 100 angstrom. Off-specular neutron scattering is most strongly
   visible at saturation field, indicating that Gd moments are not aligned
   with the applied field. X-ray resonant magnetic scattering provides
   proof of coupled in-plane length scales for both the structural and the
   magnetic roughness. A detailed x-ray scattering study of both the
   specular and off-specular reflectivities has been used to investigate
   the in-plane structure of the multilayers. We calculate the roughness
   and transverse correlation cut-off length, xi(x) = 120 +/- 30 angstrom,
   and present a simple model to determine an average column size of 27 +/-
   6 angstrom and a reduction in the magnetic saturation of similar to
   40\%.},

   layers exhibits lower ordering temperature, demonstrating the importance
   of the sequence of the layers. Both these structures order at
   temperatures significantly lower than a superlattice with a constant
   thickness of the Fe layers (three monolayers). The results highlight the

Abstract = {Evolutionary search and optimisation algorithms have been used
   successfully in many areas of materials science and chemistry. In recent
   years, these techniques have been applied to, and revolutionised the

   we present the application of a hybrid global optimisation technique,
   cultural differential evolution (CDE), to crystal structure
   determination from powder diffraction data. The combination of the
   principles of social evolution and biological evolution, through the
   pruning of the parameter search space shows significant improvement in
   the efficiency of the calculations over traditional dictates of
   biological evolution alone. Results are presented in which a range of
   algorithm control parameters, i.e., population size, mutation and
   recombination rates, extent of culture-based pruning are used to assess
   the performance of this hybrid technique. The effects of these control
   parameters on the speed and efficiency of the optimisation calculations
   are discussed, and the potential advantages of the CDE approach
   demonstrated through an average 40\% improvement in terms of speed of
   convergence of the calculations presented, and a maximum gain of 68\%

Title = {Segregation and interdiffusion in (Fe,Co)/Pt superlattices},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {79},
Number = {8},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We report on the chemical structure of (Fe,Co)/Pt superlattices, which
   recently have shown high uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy combined
   with high saturation magnetic moments. In particular, the homogeneity of
   the (Fe,Co) alloy is studied with a combination of x-ray and neutron
   reflectometry-the latter in a configuration where magnetic scattering is
   negligible. It is deduced, with support from off-specular x-ray
   reflectivity patterns and corresponding simulations, that the lower
   (Fe,Co)-on-Pt interface contains more Co than the upper Pt-on-(Fe,Co)
   interface. This can occur as Co interdiffuses into Pt more easily than
   Fe, as shown by density-functional calculations. The effect of this
   interdiffusion and segregation on the uniaxial anisotropy is discussed,
   and it is found that the previously observed discrepancy between
   experimental and theoretical anisotropy values can be quantitatively
   accounted for.},

Title = {Atomic imaging of thin films with surface x-ray diffraction: introducing
   DCAF},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {20},
Number = {44},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {A direct method for the retrieval of electron density maps from surface
   x-ray diffraction data is presented and its performance is evaluated.
   The method, DCAF (difference map using the constraints of atomicity and
   film shift), is based on the difference map iteration scheme and uses,
   apart from the traditional constraints of atomicity, positivity and film
   thickness, a novel constraint, which we have named the `film shift',
   whereby the real space solution is shifted up by an out-of-plane unit
   cell size of the underlying bulk substrate material if the topmost
   region of the same thickness contains insignificant electron density.
   This relaxes the film thickness constraint, which is necessarily loose
   in order to accommodate structural uncertainties at the film-substrate
   interface due to intermixing, roughness, and heteroepitaxial strain.
   DCAF's performance was evaluated by retrieval of the electron density
   distribution from a real data set, recorded from a five-monolayer film
   of LaAlO3 on SrTiO3, which resulted in an electron density in good
   agreement with the previously solved structure. Importantly, the
   stability and reproducibility of the final solution compares favorably
   with constraint combinations in which the film shift projection is
   omitted, highlighting the power of this new method. In addition, an
   example of a full structural solution for a three-monolayer-thick film
   of La1-xSrxMnO3 on SrTiO3 is presented, where DCAF electron density
   retrieval followed by model building and refinement was conducted.
   It will be shown that DCAF can be successfully applied to thin films for
   retrieving physically meaningful electron densities, and that it can
   also serve as a starting point for subsequent structure refinement.},

Abstract = {The element specific spin and orbital moments for Fe and Co in
   Fe40Co60/Pt (001) superlattices, with layer thicknesses d(FeCo) = 4-10
   ML and d(Pt) = 8 ML, have been studied by X-ray magnetic circular
   dichroism with focus on the interfacial magnetic moments of the Fe40Co60
   layers. The spin moments of Fe and Co showed the same relative decrease
   at the interfaces with respect to the bulk alloy. The change at the
   interface was found to be -0.9(1) of the bulk alloy spin moment. The
   orbital moment for Fe also decreased at the interfaces, whereas the Co
   orbital moment did not show any appreciable change at the interfaces. In
   addition, SQUID measurements of the total magnetization allowed the
   extraction of the induced Pt magnetic moment, which was found to be
   0.6(3)mu B/atom and is discussed with respect to previous studies. (C)

Title = {Neutron reflectometry to investigate the delivery of lipids and DNA to

Abstract = {The application of scattering methods in the study of biological and
   biomedical problems is a field of research that is currently
   experiencing fast growth. In particular, neutron reflectometry (NR) is a
   technique that is becoming progressively more widespread, as indicated
   by the current commissioning of several new reflectometers worldwide. NR
   is valuable for the characterization of biomolecules at interfaces due
   to its capability to provide quantitative structural and compositional
   information on relevant molecular length scales. Recent years have seen
   an increasing number of applications of NR to problems related to drug
   and gene delivery. We start our review by summarizing the experimental
   methodology of the technique with reference to the description of
   biological liquid interfaces. Various methods for the interpretation of
   data are then discussed, including a new approach based on the lattice
   mean-field theory to help characterize stimulus-responsive surfaces
   relevant to drug delivery function. Recent progress in the subject area
   is reviewed in terms of NR studies relevant to the delivery of lipids
   and DNA to surfaces. Lastly, we discuss two case studies to exemplify
   practical features of NR that are exploited in combination with
   complementary techniques. The first case concerns the interactions of
   lipid-based cubic phase nanoparticles with model membranes (a drug
   delivery application), and the second case concerns DNA compaction at
   surfaces and in the bulk solution (a gene delivery application). (C)

Abstract = {A series of Fe/MgO multilayers was grown on single-crystal MgO(001)
   substrates at different temperatures using magnetron sputtering. The
   structural quality of the samples was investigated by x-ray
   reflectometry, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.
   The results show a strong dependence of the structural quality on the
   growth temperature. Although good epitaxial layers are obtained at 165
   degrees C, the sample does not exhibit any superlattice diffraction
   peaks. This effect is shown to be related to a continuous variation of
   the distance between the Fe layers as well as between the MgO layers.},

Abstract = {Surface x-ray diffraction was used to determine the atomic structures of
   La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) thin films, grown monolayer by monolayer on SrTiO(3)
   by pulsed laser deposition. Structures for one-, two-, three-, four-,
   six-, and nine-monolayer-thick films were solved using the Coherent
   Bragg rod analysis phase-retrieval method and subsequent structural
   refinement. Four important results were found. First, the out-of-plane
   lattice constant is elongated across the substrate-film interface.
   Second, the transition from substrate to film is not abrupt, but
   proceeds gradually over approximately three unit cells. Third, Sr
   segregates towards the topmost monolayer of the film: we determined a
   Sr-segregation enthalpy of -15 kJ/mol from the occupation parameters.
   Finally, the electronic bandwidth W was used to explain the onset of
   magnetoresistance for films of nine or more monolayers thickness.
   Resistivity measurements of the nine monolayer-thick film confirm
   magnetoresistance and the presence of a dead layer with mostly
   insulating properties.},

Abstract = {The magnetic ordering in transition metals is strongly affected by any

   demonstrated that the reorientation of preferred magnetization
   directions can be controlled through both the growth direction and the
   strain state, which is caused by interleaving with suitable spacers, as
   well as by tuning the chemical composition if the magnetic material is
   an alloy. Both in-plane and out-of-plane easy directions can be forced
   upon the films and superlattices in this manner. Some methods for local
