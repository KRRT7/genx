  abstract  = {Thin films of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 have been deposited on single crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Due to the large lattice mismatch, three-dimensional growth is observed with strain relaxation occurring within 1-2 unit cells. The as-grown perovskite/YSZ interfaces are abrupt, despite the imperfections associated with strain relaxation. The films exhibit a single crystallographic orientation along the growth direction, with the perovskite [011] parallel to the YSZ [001]. Synchrotron diffraction and plan view transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of a columnar grain structure with the in-plane [100] and [] film directions preferentially orientated along the YSZ ⟨100⟩. The stabilization of perovskites on YSZ substrates with abrupt interfaces and a well-defined crystallographic orientation allows for the use of thin film model systems to study cathode/electrolyte interfacial reactions and morphological changes relevant to solid oxide fuel cells.},

  abstract  = {Density, elastic modulus and the pair distribution function of Co–Fe–Ta–B metallic glasses were obtained by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and measured for sputtered thin films using x-ray reflectivity, nanoindentation and x-ray diffraction using high energy photons. The computationally obtained density of 8.19 g cm−3 for Co43Fe20Ta5.5B31.5 and 8.42 g cm−3 for Co45.5Fe24Ta6B24.5, as well as the Young’s moduli of 273 and 251 GPa, respectively, are consistent with our experiments and literature data. These data, together with the good agreement between the theoretical and the experimental pair distribution functions, indicate that the model established here is useful to describe the density, elasticity and short range order of Co–Fe–Ta–B metallic glass thin films. Irrespective of the investigated variation in chemical composition, (Co, Fe)–B cluster formation and Co–Fe interactions are identified by density-of-states analysis. Strong bonds within the structural units and between the metallic species may give rise to the comparatively large stiffness.},

  abstract  = {A direct method for the retrieval of electron density maps from surface x-ray diffraction data is presented and its performance is evaluated. The method, DCAF (difference map using the constraints of atomicity and film shift), is based on the difference map iteration scheme and uses, apart from the traditional constraints of atomicity, positivity and film thickness, a novel constraint, which we have named the ‘film shift’, whereby the real space solution is shifted up by an out-of-plane unit cell size of the underlying bulk substrate material if the topmost region of the same thickness contains insignificant electron density. This relaxes the film thickness constraint, which is necessarily loose in order to accommodate structural uncertainties at the film–substrate interface due to intermixing, roughness, and heteroepitaxial strain.

DCAF’s performance was evaluated by retrieval of the electron density distribution from a real data set, recorded from a five-monolayer film of LaAlO3 on SrTiO3, which resulted in an electron density in good agreement with the previously solved structure. Importantly, the stability and reproducibility of the final solution compares favorably with constraint combinations in which the film shift projection is omitted, highlighting the power of this new method. In addition, an example of a full structural solution for a three-monolayer-thick film of La1−xSrxMnO3 on SrTiO3 is presented, where DCAF electron density retrieval followed by model building and refinement was conducted.

It will be shown that DCAF can be successfully applied to thin films for retrieving physically meaningful electron densities, and that it can also serve as a starting point for subsequent structure refinement.},

   At the lowest concentration (5\% w/w), a preferential adsorption of the

   magnetic structures of rare-earth superlattices as a means to understand
   the rich and exotic magnetic properties of the rare-earth metals.
   High-quality samples can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire
   substrates by first depositing a thin epitaxial layer of niobium, then a
   layer of yttrium or lutetium as a seed. High-resolution x-ray scattering
   is an excellent probe to characterise the crystal quality and was used
   to study the structure of the niobium layer. However, relatively little
   attention was paid to the seed layer. This article summarises some of
   the x-ray experiments performed by the Cowley group to study the
   structure of epitaxial (110) niobium on (11 (2) over bar0) sapphire, and
   extends the work to report some results on the structure of thin (0 00
   1) yttrium seed layers. The structure of the yttrium films is shown to
   have a strong dependence on the thickness of the niobium buffer, with
   the buffer needing to be thicker than a critical value of similar to 80
   degrees A for the formation of misfit dislocations at the Nb/Al2O3
   interface before highly coherent Y films can be grown. Yttrium films
   grown on Nb buffers thinner than similar to 500 degrees A show a similar
   two-peak line shape in q(perpendicular to) scans through their specular
   Bragg peaks to that seen in the specular Nb Bragg peaks, with a
   resolution-limited feature on a broader diffuse peak. The
   resolution-limited feature depends on the thickness of the yttrium film,
   becoming weaker and having a stronger decay with increasing q(parallel
   to) as the film thickness increases, while the width of the yttrium
   broad peak evolves as the square root of the width of the niobium Bragg
   peak. The data are discussed within the context of theories describing
   the scattering from films with misfit dislocations.}},

Title = {{Magnetic Skyrmions in a Hall Balance with Interfacial Canted
   Magnetizations}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient
   information-storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been
   experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including
   ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of
   skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful
   pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions.
   However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is
   still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating
   spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate
   to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high-density
   Neel-type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room
   temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall
   balance (core structure {[}Co/Pt](n)/NiO/{[}Co/Pt](n)) with interfacial
   canted magnetizations because of interlayer
   ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom
   {[}Co/Pt](n)multilayers, where the Co layers in {[}Co/Pt](n)are always
   ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the
   generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer
   exchange coupling (IEC) and easy-axis orientation. Direct experimental
   evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided,
   suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative
   mechanism for room-temperature spintronics.}},

   thin films deposited using reactive dc magnetron sputtering. The optimum
   substrate temperature (T-s) to grow an stoichiometric Fe4N phase is
   about 673 K, in agreement with earlier works. However, at this T-s, we
   found that significant intermixing is taking place at the substrate-film
   interface, affecting the M-s of Fe4N film, adversely. We performed
   secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements to extract the
   extent of such intermixing. It was found that Si from the SiO2 substrate
   get interdiffused into Fe4N film forming an undesired interface
   extending up to almost half of the film. As a result, the average M-s of
   Fe4N film get reduced by about 25\% as compared to its theoretical
   value. To prohibit such intermixing, we placed thin layers of Ag, Cu, or
   CrN as a buffer layer between the substrate and Fe4N film. Such buffer
   layer suppress the extent of interdiffusion remarkably. From SIMS
   measurements, we found that among all buffer layers, CrN is most
   suitable as it reduces the extent of intermixing to a minimum level.
   Magnetization measurements performed using bulk magnetization and
   polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) methods also clearly revealed that
   the M-s was the highest when CrN buffer layer was used. From these
   results, it becomes apparent that the intermixing taking place at the
   substrate-film interface plays a vital role in affecting the M-s of Fe4N
   thin films. To further suppress such intermixing an attempt was also
   made to bring down the T-s from 673 to 523 K. Obtained results are
   presented and discussed in this work.}},

  abstract  = {{In solid-state chemistry, the direct reaction of elements at low
   temperatures is limited by low solid-state interdiffusion rates. This
   and the limited number of processing parameters often prevent the
   synthesis of metastable compounds. Precisely controlling the number of
   atoms and nanoarchitecture of layered elemental precursors enabled the
   selective synthesis of two closely related metastable tin vanadium
   selenides via near-diffusionless reactions at low temperatures. Although
   the nanoarchitectures of the precursors required to form
   {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) and {[}(SnSe)(1.15)](1) (VSe2)(1) are very
   similar, controlling the local composition of the SnISe layers in the
   precursors enables the selective synthesis of either compound. The
   metastable alloy SnxV1-xSe2 was preferentially formed over
   {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1), which has the identical composition, by
   modifying the nanoarchitecture of the precursor. Ex situ in-plane X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray reflectivity collected as a function of annealing
   temperature provided information on lateral and perpendicular growth of
   {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1). The presence of Laue oscillations
   throughout the self-assembly provided atomic-scale information on the
   thickness of the {[}(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) domains, giving insights
   into the self-assembly process. A reaction mechanism is proposed and
   used to rationalize how composition and nanoarchitecture control the
   reaction pathway through the free energy landscape.}},

Title = {{Structure of Reduced Cerium Oxide Ultrathin Films on Pt(111): Local
   Atomic Environment and Long-Range Order}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Abstract = {{To optimize the catalytic functionality of cerium oxide it is important
   to understand the structural modifications associated with reduction and
   the role of the proximity of metals, which are often coupled with the
   oxide in the applications. For this purpose, the evolution of the short-
   and long-range structure of cerium oxide ultrathin epitaxial films and
   nanostructures supported on Pt(111) is investigated using X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy at the Ce L(3)edge and surface X-ray
   diffraction, during reduction by thermal treatments in vacuum. In
   epitaxial nanoislands reduction is associated with a contraction of the
   Ce-O distance and with the appearance of Ce-Pt bonds. The formation of a
   phase with a (2 x 2) periodicity after a thermal treatment at 1023 K is
   ascribed to the formation of a Pt5Ce alloy. Films of 3 nm thickness do
   not show, on average, significant structural modifications with the same
   thermal treatment, consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction
   involves only the topmost surface layers and it does not influence
   significantly the bulk structure of the material. This study
   demonstrates a strong interaction between cerium oxide and platinum,
   which has implications for the reactivity and stability of catalysts
   based on metals combined with reducible oxides.}},

   PdOx at 100 degrees C. The amount of PdOx that forms is dependent on the
   duration of coexposure of O-2 at 1 Torr and VUV irradiation. A minimum
   coexposure time of 1 min is required to partially oxidize 2 nm Pd while
   3 min is required for 20 nm Pd films, which is verified in situ using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Formic acid vapor is used to
   complete the etch cycle, which does not etch Pd-0 and only removes the
   PdOx that forms. Repeated etch cycles on a similar to 20 nm Pd thin film
   yield an etch rate of 2.81 angstrom/cycle, which is characterized in
   situ using XPS and ex situ using X-ray reflectivity. The morphology of

   linearly. For GdCo, the reversal field, H-c, increases by less than a
   factor of two with Gd doping of 11\%, while for Fe, the coercivity falls

   coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The best fit
   CTR model suggested that Pb(II) sorbed selectively to one type of
   edge-sharing surface site (ES2) over two other potential surface sites.
   From the best fit model structure, it was found that the Pb surface
   complex species forms a trigonal pyramid geometry. The base consists of
   three oxygen groups, two of which are associated with the substrate
   surface (O-I and O-III) and one that is a distal O extending toward
   solution. The trigonal pyramid geometry is slightly distorted with Pb-O
   bond lengths ranging from 2.21 to 2.31 angstrom and O-Pb-O bond angles
   ranging from 72 degrees to 75 degrees. Under this structural distortion,
   the nearest distance between Pb and Fe is found to be 3.39(1) angstrom.
   Consistent with the CTR results, DFT calculations indicate the Pb
   binding energy at the ES2 site is at least 0.16 eV more favorable than
   that at the other two potential binding sites considered. Using
   bond-valence rules we propose a stoichiometry of Pb(II) binding on the
   hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface which indicates proton release
   through the deprotonation of all oxygen groups bonding to Pb.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling the
   activity of a given catalyst. This work combines operando
   characterization and computational techniques to examine the oxygen
   evolution reaction mechanism on RuO2 surfaces.
   Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling
   (electro)catalytic activity. Here we employed surface X-ray scattering
   coupled with density functional theory and surface-enhanced infrared
   absorption spectroscopy to examine the oxygen evolution reaction on RuO2
   surfaces as a function of voltage. At 1.5 V-RHE, our results suggest
   that there is an -OO group on the coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium
   (Ru-CUS) site of the (100) surface (and similarly for (110)), but
   adsorbed oxygen on the Ru-CUS site of (101). Density functional theory
   results indicate that the removal of -OO from the Ru-CUS site, which is
   stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a neighbouring -OH (-OO-H), could be
   the rate-determining step for (100) (similarly for (110)), where its
   reduced binding on (100) increased activity. A further reduction in
   binding energy on the Ru-CUS site of (101) resulted in a different
   rate-determining step (-O + H2O - (H+ + e(-)) -> -OO-H) and decreased
   activity. Our study provides molecular details on the active sites, and
   the influence of their local coordination environment on activity.}},

   is analyzed in combination with ab initio finite difference method
   calculations and spherical tensor analysis. It provides an assignment of
   the three pre-edge peaks beyond the octahedral crystal field splitting
   approximation and estimates the spatial extension of the corresponding
   final states. It is then discussed for the first time the X-ray
   absorption (XAS) of pentacoordinated titanium atoms due to oxygen
   vacancies and it is found that, similarly to anatase TiO2, rutile is
   expected to exhibit a transition on the low-energy side of peak A3. Its
   apparent absence in the experiment is related to the degree of p-d
   orbital mixing which is small in rutile due to its centrosymmetric point
   group. A recent XAS linear dichroism study on anatase TiO2 single
   crystals has shown that peak A2 has an intrinsic origin and is due to a
   quadrupolar transition to the 3d energy levels. In rutile, due to its
   centrosymmetric point group, the corresponding peak A2 has a small
   dipole moment explaining the weak transition. The results are confronted

Abstract = {{Multilevel remanence states have potential applications in
   ultra-high-density storage and neuromorphic computing. Continuous
   tailoring of the multilevel remanence states by spin-orbit torque (SOT)
   is reported in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/IrMn heterostructures.
   Double-biased hysteresis loops with only one remanence state can be
   tuned from the positively or negatively single-biased loops by SOT
   controlled sign of the exchange-bias field. The remanence states
   associated with the heights of the sub-loops are continually changed by
   tuning the ratio of the positively and negatively oriented ferromagnetic
   domains. The multilevel storage cells are demonstrated by reading the
   remanent Hall resistance through changing the sign and/or the magnitude
   of current pulse. The synaptic plasticity behaviors for neuromorphic
   computing are also simulated by varying the remanent Hall resistance
   under the consecutive current pulses. This work demonstrates that SOT is
   an effective method to tailor the remanence states in the double-biased
   heavy metal/ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic system. The
   multilevel-stable remanence states driven by SOT show potential
   applications in future multilevel memories and neuromorphic computing

   one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults
   worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a
   mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional
   deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled
   electrophysiological-mechanical model with several free parameters that
   are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The
   calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm
   (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration
   of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several
   minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter
   tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a
   simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The
   model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more
   realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to
   run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a
   parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor
   taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel
   DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort
   achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time.
   While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the
   resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve
   damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration

   diffusion have been investigated systematically in Co/Ti multilayers
   with ultra-short (similar to 18 angstrom) bi-layer thickness. Co/Ti
   multilayers with 10,20,40,60 and 80 bi-layers have been grown using an
   indigenously built in-line dc magnetron sputtering system having
   application as reflecting optics in the water window soft X-ray regime
   of 23-44 angstrom. Specular and diffused Grazing Incidence X-ray
   reflectivity measurements with hard X-rays have been used to evaluate
   detailed interfacial structure of the multilayers. It is observed that
   interfacial atomic diffusion of Co into Ti layers is significant in such
   ultra-short period multilayer structures and it increases as more number
   of layers are added in the multilayer stack. As a result of Co diffusion
   into Ti the physical density of Ti layer increases and also effective
   thickness of Co layer decreases. Since the thickness of the Ti layers
   are in sub-nm range, it is found that this diffusion is not limited only
   to the interface region of Co-on-Ti, rather it spreads throughout the
   bulk of Ti layer. Finally, soft X-ray reflectivity measurement on the
   multilayers with synchrotron radiation at 28 angstrom wavelength shows
   that the peak reflectivity is limited by the significant diffusion at
   the Co/Ti interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{For HfO2-based films, which are mainly prepared by atomic layer
   deposition, the desired ferroelectric (FE) properties typically vanish
   while extending the thickness beyond a limit of about 50 nm. Herein, the
   successful fabrication of a 1 mu m-thick piezoelectric La:HfO2 film is
   demonstrated using chemical solution deposition, paving the way toward
   sensor and actuator applications. After identifying the optimal La
   content, the film thickness is increased from 45 nm to 1 mu m.
   Polarization and strain measurements evidence the persistence of the FE
   properties at all thicknesses and even a slight improvement due to a
   better orientation of the polar axis at higher thicknesses. Scanning
   electron microscopy and X-ray reflectivity reveal a fine-grained
   microstructure and a density of only 80\% of the theoretical value,
   which seems to be a common issue of solution-deposited HfO2-based films,
   based on the performed literature survey. Using tilt-angle-dependent
   X-ray diffraction scans, homogeneous nucleation is found to be the
   likely root cause of the observed microstructure. It is suggested that
   this microstructure issue is key for the optimization of cycling
   stability of solution-based films to exploit the full potential of the
   HfO2 for cost-efficient, thick piezoelectric films.}},

   contribution, three BHJ film systems, composed of polymer donor PBDB-T,

   small-molecule acceptor ITIC, and polymer acceptor N2200) are
   systematically investigated using neutron reflectometry to examine how

   composition distribution. Our results show that those three BHJ films
   possess homogeneous vertical composition distributions across the bulk
   of the film, while very different composition accumulations near the top
   and bottom surface were observed, which could be attributed to different
   repulsion, miscibility, and phase separation between the donor and
   acceptor components as approved by the measurement of the donor acceptor
   Flory Huggins interaction parameter chi. Moreover, the solvent additive
   1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) can induce more distinct vertical composition
   distribution especially in nonfullerene acceptor-based BHJ films. Thus,
   higher power conversion efficiencies were achieved in inverted solar

   Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) was first evaluated as a precursor for the formation
   of thin films of the binary oxide Pr2O3 by using water as the
   coreactant. Self-limited growth of Pr2O3 was demonstrated for pulse
   lengths of >= 3 s, with a growth rate of similar to 0.85 angstrom/cycle.
   The ALD growth of PrAlO3 films was examined on Si, thermal SiO2, and
   (001)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Self-limited growth was demonstrated
   for Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3), AlMe3, and water at 300 degrees C by using a 1:1
   ratio of the number of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses. An ALD
   window was observed from 275 to 325 degrees C with a growth rate of
   similar to 1.7 angstrom/cycle. The as-deposited PrAlO3 films on all
   substrates were amorphous, had smooth surfaces, and contained <0.5\%
   carbon, as analyzed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering,
   X-ray reflectivity, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively.
   Films grown with a 1:1 ratio of Pr(C(5)H(4)iPr)(3) and AlMe3 pulses were
   aluminum-rich (Pr:Al similar to 1:1.2-1.4). Heating PrAlO3 layers
   deposited on SrTiO3 to 800 degrees C for 3 h resulted in fully
   crystallized PrAlO3 films. The crystallized PrAlO3 films were highly
   (001)-oriented. The PrAlO3 00L and SrTiO3 00L reflections appeared on
   the same rod of reciprocal space, further indicating that the amorphous
   PrAlO3 film transforms into an epitaxial layer. The rocking curve width
   of the PrAlO3 (001) reflection was 7 degrees. By contrast, PrAlO3 films
   deposited on Si substrates with native oxide remained amorphous after
   annealing at 1000 degrees C for 8 h. The difference in the
   crystallization between PrAlO3 layers deposited on crystalline SrTiO3
   and amorphous native SiO2 substrates indicates that PrAlO3 on SrTiO3
   crystallized by solid-phase epitaxy, in which the nucleation and
   orientation of the crystallized layer are set by the atomic

   Opposed to Fe4N, the formation of a stoichiometric Co4N turns out to be
   extremely difficult. A review of the literature of Co4N compound suggest
   that the experimental lattice parameter (LP) was always found to be
   smaller than the theoretical predicted value. It can also be seen that
   as the substrate temperature (T-s) increases, the LP of Co4N film
   decreases. In this work, we deposited Co4N films using molecular beam
   epitaxy (MBE), direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and high power
   impulse MS (HiPIMS). Films were characterized using X-ray diffraction,
   X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. It was found that at

   phase. We found that the MBE deposited films did not show any signature

   be assigned to fcc Co rather than Co4N. On the other hand, the dcMS and

   300 K. Detailed analysis of Co4N films grown using dcMS and HiPIMS
   reveals that HiPIMS grown films are single phase and have a denser

   based on a 3-layer two-temperature model (3l-TTM). The rationale for
   this study is to critically assess the role of the electron-phonon
   coupling factor of the interlayer along with its thickness on the TBC.
   It is shown that the TBC of both systems rapidly increases with the
   interlayer thickness until reaching a stable plateau for thicknesses
   greater than 1.5 nm. The plateau average value is 15\%-25\% lower than
   the intrinsic TBC between the interlayer material and the diamond
   substrate. This behavior and values of the TBC of both systems are in
   good agreement with the predictions of the 3l-TTM. The predictability of
   this model is also analyzed for a Cu interlayer inserted at Au/silicon
   interfaces with thicknesses ranging from 1.5 to 20 nm. While the room
   temperature TBC of this system is well described by the 3l-TTM, the
   values measured at 80 K can only be predicted by the 3l-TTM, provided
   that the interlayer electron-phonon coupling factor is reduced by a
   factor of 2, as was experimentally observed for Ag and Au. The obtained

   high-speed and low-energy phase change memory (PCM) application. The
   high speed of 10 ns and the low threshold voltage of 1.6 V have been
   achieved, originating from the crystal-like octahedral motifs in the
   amorphous phase, in which crystallization can be accomplished by the
   shifting or rotation of these motifs. The good endurance of 10(5) cycles
   is due to the small volume change of 4.6\% and the formation of a
   homogenous phase during crystallization, which reduces the risk of
   stress- and segregation-induced device failure. The nucleation-dominated
   crystallization behavior of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is observed, where the Ge
   atoms with lowest electronegativity are preferred to occupy the center
   cation layers in the nonuple-layer block, whereas the less metallic Bi

Abstract = {{Current induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in perpendicularly magnetized
   heavy metal/ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal trilayers has been widely
   studied to achieve the current-induced magnetization switching.
   Decreasing the critical switching current-density (J(C)) is a primary
   factor in the performance of memory or logic devices because J(C)
   directly affects the power consumption of the devices. This work
   demonstrates the influences of inserting a transition metal copper (Cu)
   layer between the Co/Ta interface in the Pt/Co/Ta structures with
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) on the J(C), SOT, coercive
   field, and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field (H-an). The results
   show that J(C) decreases significantly when the thickness of Cu layer is
   above 3 nm, compared with the Pt/Co/Ta control sample, under
   consideration of the shunting effect of Cu layer. The decrease of J(C)
   is the result of the competition between the modified SOT and H-an due
   to the insertion of Cu. The study suggests that the critical switching
   current-density of SOT-switching can be decreased by inserting a
   transition metal Cu layer.}},

   reflectivity results reveal that the stoichiometric sample shows
   enhanced interfacial magnetization relative to the rest of the film. The
   oxygen-deficient sample exhibits a reduced average magnetization from
   the optimized recipe. Both films show regions of suppressed
   magnetization at the surface regardless of the growth pressure. The
   oxygen stoichiometric film does not show an interfacial dead layer,

   stoichiometric film shows a constant magnetization direction across the
   film. These results suggest that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies
   during growth leads to an accumulation of vacancies at the interface,
   which is enhanced at higher temperature due to increased oxygen
   mobility, creating a region of reduced magnetism that couples to the
   rest of the film. These results offer insight into the complex behavior
   and role of oxygen vacancies in the magnetism of these systems.

   F gamma films were synthesized via topotactic fluorination of SrMnO2.5
   films using polytetrafluoroethylene as the fluorine source. Oxidized
   SrMnO3 films were also prepared for comparison with the fluorinated
   samples. The F content, probed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, was

   Electronic transport measurements reveal that increased F content (up to
   gamma = 0.14) systematically increases the electrical resistivity,
   despite the nominal electron-doping induced by F substitution for O in
   these films. In contrast, oxidized SrMnO3 exhibits a decreased
   resistivity and conduction activation energy. A blue-shift of optical
   absorption features occurs with increasing F content. Density functional
   theory calculations indicate that F acts as a scattering center for
   electronic transport, controls the observed weak ferromagnetic behavior
   of the films, and reduces the inter-band optical transitions in the
   manganite films. These results stand in contrast to bulk electron-doped

   purpose to introduce a 4-nm-thick buffer layer of MgO in between Fe2O3
   and GaN was to stop thermal migration of Ga into the iron oxide layer.
   Though such migration and successive formation of the orthorhombic
   GaFeO3 was supposed earlier to be a potential trigger of the nucleation
   of the isostructural epsilon-Fe2O3, the present work demonstrates that
   the growth of single crystalline uniform films of epsilon ferrite by
   pulsed laser deposition is possible even on the MgO capped GaN. The
   structural properties of the 60-nm-thick Fe2O3 layer on MgO/GaN were
   probed by electron and x-ray diffraction, both suggesting that the
   growth of epsilon-Fe2O3 is preceded by formation of a thin layer of
   gamma-Fe2O3. The presence of the magnetically hard epsilon ferrite was
   independently confirmed by temperature dependent magnetometry
   measurements. The depth-resolved x-ray and polarized neutron
   reflectometry reveal that the 10 nm iron oxide layer at the interface
   has a lower density and a higher magnetization than the main volume of

   10.1 angstrom. Transmission electron microscopy reveals antisite
   disorder and growth defects to be present in the films, but evidence of

   orientation, with the (110) film showing the least. Magnetization
   measurements at 1.8 K show the expected magnetic anisotropy and
   saturation magnetization values associated with a spin ice for all
   orientations; shape anisotropy is apparent when comparing in- and
   out-of-plane directions. Significantly, only the (110)-oriented films
   display the hallmark spin-ice plateau state in magnetization, albeit
   less well defined compared to the plateau observed in a single crystal.
   Neutron-scattering maps on the more disordered (111)-oriented films show
   the Q = 0 phase previously observed in bulk materials, but the Q = X
   phase giving the plateau state remains elusive. We conclude that the

   study of novel quantum phenomena building on time-reversal
   symmetry-broken topological surface states. By combining different
   magnetic TIs in a heterostructure, their magnetic and electronic
   properties can be precisely tuned. Recently, we have combined
   high-moment Dy:Bi2Te3 with high transition temperature Cr: Sb2Te3 in a
   superlattice, and we found, using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
   (XMCD), that long-range magnetic order can be introduced in the
   Dy:Bi2Te3 layers. Accompanying first-principles calculations indicated
   that the origin of the long-range magnetic order is a strong
   antiferromagnetic coupling between Dy and Cr magnetic moments at the
   interface extending over several layers. However, based on XMCD alone,
   which is either averaging over the entire thin-film stack or is
   surface-sensitive, this coupling scenario could not be fully confirmed.
   Here we use polarized neutron reflectometry, which is ideally suited for
   the detailed study of superlattices, to retrieve the magnetization in a
   layer- and interface-resolved way. We find that the magnetization is, in
   contrast to similar recent studies, homogeneous throughout the
   individual layers, with no apparent interfacial effects. This finding
   demonstrates that heterostructure engineering is a powerful way of
   controlling the magnetic properties of entire layers, with the effects

   (J(C)) refers to the minimum current density required to generate
   spin-orbit torque (SOT) for effective magnetization manipulation,
   including switching of magnetization and moving of domain walls and
   magnetic skyrmions. This critical current density is a key factor for
   next-generation SOT-based magnetic random access memory, racetrack
   memory, and logic devices. In this work, the critical current density
   for magnetization switching and the thermal stability of Pt/Co/Ta
   heterostructures in response to ion irradiation are studied. It is found
   that ion irradiation represents a promising approach for the wide tuning
   of the magnetic properties, such as the coercive force and the
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy constant. It is also found that J(C)
   is significantly reduced after 500eV Ar+ irradiation. Meanwhile, the
   ratio between the thermal stability factor E/k(B)T and J(C) increases
   with an increase in the irradiation dose, although E/k(B)T decreases
   slightly with the irradiation dose. This work demonstrates that J(C) can
   be significantly reduced by an appropriate ion irradiation process and

   characterization of such systems is often performed using x-ray
   reflectometry (XRR). For complex stacks of multiple layers, low electron
   density contrast materials, or very thin layers without any pronounced
   angular minima, this requires a full modeling of the XRR data. As such a
   modeling is using the thicknesses, the densities, and the roughnesses of
   each layer as parameters, this approach quickly results in a large
   number of free parameters. In consequence, cross correlation effects or
   interparameter dependencies can falsify the modeling results. Here, the
   authors present a route for validation of such modeling results which is
   based on the reference-free grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF)
   methodology. In conjunction with the radiometrically calibrated
   instrumentation of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, the method
   allows for reference-free quantification of the elemental mass
   depositions. In addition, a modeling approach of reference-free
   GIXRF-XRR data is presented, which takes advantage of the quantifiable
   elemental mass depositions by distributing them depth dependently. This

   Co-N. On the other hand, in previous attempts the Co4N phase has always

   fcc Co could have been mistaken for Co4N, probably due to the closeness
   of their lattice parameters (LP; fcc Co = 3.54 angstrom, Co4N = 3.74
   angstrom). Therefore, Co4N - an interesting material for its high

   bringing down the growth temperature, we report the growth of

   (Ms) of Co4N samples were measured using polarized neutron reflectivity

   Co4N is higher due to a magnetovolume effect. Unlike previous findings,
   we observed that substrates induce misfit strain and strain
   inhomogeneity is the cause of modifications in magnetic ensemble such as
   coercivity, saturation magnetization, and magnetic anisotropy. A
   consequence of incoherent strain present in our samples is also
   reflected in the magnetic anisotropy leading to a superposition of

   offer a solution. Realizing commercially viable virtual substrates
   requires the growth of high-quality films at high growth rates for
   large-scale production. We report the stoichiometric growth of SrTiO3
   exceeding 600 nm hr(-1). This tenfold increase in growth rate compared
   to SrTiO3 grown on silicon by conventional methods is enabled by a
   self-regulated growth window accessible in hybrid molecular beam

   (oxyhydr)oxides constitute critical steps in natural geochemical iron
   cycling. However, the atomic-scale mechanisms of reductive dissolution
   and oxidative precipitation of Fe2+ remain poorly understood because
   they are difficult to directly experimentally probe. Using in situ
   synchrotron X-ray scattering and a novel electrochemical cell, we
   interrogate the interfacial structure between the hematite (alpha-Fe2O3)
   (1 (1) over bar 02) surface and acidic aqueous solution (5 mM Na2SO4, pH
   4.0) under controlled electrochemical potential from the open circuit
   condition to cathodic bias as the reductive dissolution potential is
   approached and then exceeded. The crystalline order of the surface
   improves under mild reducing conditions, and the surface Fe
   stoichiometry changes with cathodic bias. After significant reductive
   dissolution occurs and cathodic bias is removed, dissolved Fe is
   redeposited, forming a disordered interface. Unlike at circumneutral pH,
   water layers at the hematite interface with acidic solution are poorly
   ordered, likely due to the adsorption of sulfate from the electrolyte.
   These results provide a novel atomic-scale view into the behavior of

   to select the locations of nucleation and the crystallographic
   orientation of the resulting crystals. Nucleation sites for
   crystallization of the prototypical perovskite complex oxide SrTiO3
   (STO) from its amorphous form can be reproducibly introduced using
   nanoscale seed crystals. The results of two seeding strategies are
   reported here: (i) SrRuO3 (SRO) (001)-oriented nanomembranes and (ii)
   STO nanocrystalline seeds. Amorphous STO crystallizes laterally over
   distances of several microns from the seeds before encountering
   separately nucleated crystals. The lateral crystallization rates for
   both types of seeding methods are close to the values measured in
   solidphase epitaxy (SPE) of STO on single-crystal substrates. The
   lateral crystallization distances along different crystallographic
   orientations are equal, indicating that the lateral crystallization rate
   is isotropic. The isotropic crystallization suggests that the
   rate-limiting steps for crystallization occur within the amorphous STO
   away from the amorphous/crystalline interface. In addition to the
   lateral crystallization, STO crystallizes on top of the planar SRO
   nanomembrane seeds via SPE, forming partially relaxed {[}001]-oriented
   heteroepitaxial STO layers. The in-plane orientation of laterally
   crystallized STO near the SRO nanomembrane seeds exhibits overall
   polycrystallinity with regions in which micron-scale grains of laterally

   surfaces were tested. The detailed structure of these interfaces was
   studied, allowing distinction of two different cases of M/Si couples:
   (i) some amount of interfacial reaction exists for both surface
   terminations, resulting in similar TBCs; and (ii) chemically abrupt
   interfaces are achieved, resulting in TBC values that are always lower

   allowed identifying a tendency of the TBC to scale with the maximum
   transmission limit. A possible influence of the substrate was evaluated
   using both the diffuse mismatch model (DMM), which predicts a strong
   dependence on the substrate properties, and a newly developed approach
   based on the metal irradiance (IM), which predicts no dependence on the
   substrate properties. The DMM was implemented using a Debye model with
   either a linear (DMMLinear) or a Sine-Type (DMMSineType) dispersion,
   while the IM was implemented using a Sine-Type (IMSineType) dispersion.
   The DMMLinear and the IMSineType were found to be more suitable than the
   DMMSineType and to be equally precise in predicting TBC at metal/silicon
   and metal/sapphire interfaces. The IMSineType is found to be better
   suited than both the DMMLinear and the DMMSineType to predict TBC at
   metal/diamond interfaces. IMSineType being the only model tested that is
   suitable for all three substrates, it appears to be the most appropriate
   choice. As a corollary, we find that the TBC dependence on substrate

   measurements. Subsequently, few Mo/Si multilayers having 5 bi-layers
   with different Mo to bi-layer thickness ratio (Gamma) at a fixed
   bi-layer thickness have been deposited and characterized by GIXRR
   measurements. Investigation has been carried out on the different
   behaviors of the interfaces and also variation of the interface width
   with Gamma has been studied. Finally, 25 bi-layer Mo/Si multilayer
   samples having the lowest Gamma value and with and without carbon
   diffusion barrier layer at both the Mo/Si interfaces are deposited and
   the interfaces have been characterized by hard X-ray and soft X-ray
   reflectivity measurements. The study shows improvement in reflectivities
   of the multilayer with carbon diffusion barrier layer from 38\% to 54\%
   at 130 angstrom wavelength. To have further insight into the
   modification of the interface due to introduction of the carbon barrier
   layer, depth selective study of both the multilayers have been carried
   out by Grazing Incidence Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure
   measurements using synchrotron radiation and thereby investigating the
   local structures around Mo atoms in Si bulk region and Si-on-Mo
   interface. This study confirms the reduction of diffusion of Mo and Si
   layer into each other when the carbon buffer layers are present at the
   interfaces, thus reducing the chance of formation of MoSi2.}},

   saturation magnetization falls as the proximity magnetization in Pt is
   reduced, whilst the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy K-u rises. The
   micromagnetic DMI strength D was determined using the bubble expansion
   technique and also rises from a negligible value when x = 0 to similar
   to 1 mJ/m(2) for x = 1. The depinning field at which field-driven domain
   wall motion crosses from the creep to the depinning regime rises from

   an opportunity to control magnetism in nanoscale heterostructures with
   electric fields. In this paper, we investigate the influence of chemical
   composition and crystallographic orientation on the interfacial
   magnetism of BFO/LSMO superlattices. Our results reveal that the induced
   net magnetic moment in the BFO layers increases monotonically with
   increasing saturation magnetization of the LSMO layers. For the
   (100)-BFO/LSMO (x = 0.2) superlattice, the induced moment reaches a
   record high value of similar to 2.8 mu(B)/Fe. No interfacial
   magnetization is observed at the (100)-BFO/LSMO interface when LSMO is
   an antiferromagnet. In contrast to (100)-oriented superlattices, no
   induced moment is observed in (111)-BFO layers. Our results suggest the
   interfacial structural reconstruction may not be a sufficient condition
   for the enhanced net moment in BFO layer. Instead, spin canting induced
   by interfacial exchange coupling is proposed in the (100)-but not in the
   (111)-BFO, leading to the large net magnetization at the (100)-oriented

   Domain Thermoreflectance. Overall, a monotonic increase in the TBC was
   observed over the first 10 nm, before reaching a plateau. In some cases,
   it was also observed that an interlayer reduces the TBC as compared to
   the reference system. This is rationalized by assuming that the TBC
   evolution as a function of the interlayer thickness is controlled by (i)
   a contribution of the gold layer that has to be taken into account for
   all phonons having a wavelength larger than the interlayer thickness and
   (ii) a thickness-dependent resistance within the interlayer that appears

  abstract             = {{Rutile RuO2 is a highly active catalyst for a number of
   (electro)chemical reactions in aqueous solutions or in humid
   environments. However, the study of the interaction of RuO2 surfaces
   with water has been confined largely to the ultrahigh vacuum environment
   and to the thermodynamically stable (110) surface. In this work, we
   combine ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ
   surface diffraction, and density functional theory calculations to
   investigate how four different facets of RuO2 interact with water under
   humid and electrochemical environments. The vacant coordinatively
   unsaturated Ru site (CUS) allows for the adsorption and dissociation of
   water molecules. Different surfaces exhibit unique binding energetics
   for -H2O and -OH and can allow for different degrees of hydrogen bonding
   between the adsorbates. Consequently, the degree of water dissociation
   is found to be sensitive to the surface crystallographic
   orientation-being maximum for the (101) surface, followed by the (110),
   (001) and (100) surfaces. This study identifies crystallographic
   orientation as an important parameter to tune not only the density of
   active sites but also the energetics for water dissociation; this
   finding is of great significance for many catalytic reactions, where
   water is a key reactant, or product.}},

   applications, thanks to the low cost of integration with current
   manufacturing processes and the good scaling behavior. Despite intensive
   research efforts that are devoted to the modification of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)
   phase-change material, the obtained improvements are still
   unsatisfactory for high-performance applications. In this paper,
   SiC-modification is first introduced to enhance the amorphous stability
   of GST without sacrificing its transition speed. Several enhancements
   can be demonstrated, including better thermal stability (10-year data
   retention above 120 degrees C), lower RESET voltage (about 3.0 V at 20
   ns pulse width), reduced volume change (smaller than 3.0\%), and
   expected operation cycles (more than 1.0 x 10(5)). According to the
   findings, the local bonding nature of Ge/Te atoms can be tuned by C/Si
   dopants through forming CGe and SiTe bonds. Apart from strengthening the
   atomic binding network for desirable data retention, the element
   interdiffusion is also effectively controlled and suppressed. Together
   with finer grains, smaller density change, and more uniform morphology,
   the modified structure transition finally contributes to the reduced
   switching voltage and long-term endurance. Hence, it is envisaged that
   SiC-doped GST with such advantages will give a competitive option for
   high-density and high-performance embedded memory.}},

   smoothly from the bulklike values of one Bohr magneton per Fe atom for
   FeGe to zero for nonmagnetic CoGe. The chiral lattice structure leads to
   a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the films' helical
   magnetic ground state was confirmed using polarized neutron
   reflectometry measurements. The pitch of the spin helix, measured by
   this method, varies with Co content y and diverges at y similar to 0.45.
   This indicates a zero crossing of the DMI, which we reproduced in
   calculations using first-principles methods. We also measured the
   longitudinal and Hall resistivity of our films as a function of magnetic
   field, temperature, and Co content y. The Hall resistivity is expected
   to contain contributions from the ordinary, anomalous, and topological
   Hall effects. Both the anomalous and topological Hall resistivities show
   peaks around y similar to 0.5. Our first-principles calculations show a
   peak in the topological Hall constant at this value of y, related to the
   strong spin polarization predicted for intermediate values of y. Our
   calculations predict half-metallicity for y = 0.6, consistent with the
   experimentally observed linear magnetoresistance at this composition,
   and potentially related to the other unusual transport properties for
   intermediate value of y. While it is possible to reconcile theory with
   experiment for the various Hall effects for FeGe, the large topological
   Hall resistivities for y similar to 0.5 are much larger than expected
   when the very small emergent fields associated with the divergence in
   the DMI are taken into account.}},

   approach to break time-reversal symmetry in a topological insulator
   (TI)-a prerequisite for unlocking the TI's exotic potential. Recently,
   we reported the doping of Bi2Te3 thin films with rare-earth ions, which,
   owing to their large magnetic moments, promise commensurately large
   magnetic gap openings in the topological surface states. However, only
   when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in angle-resolved
   photoemission spectroscopy, which persists up to room temperature.
   Although disorder alone could be ruled out as a cause of the topological
   phase transition, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic and
   electronic properties of Dy-doped Bi2Te3 remained elusive. Here, we
   present an x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized neutron
   reflectometry, muon-spin rotation, and resonant photoemission study of
   the microscopic magnetic and electronic properties. We find that the
   films are not simply paramagnetic but that instead the observed behavior
   can be well explained by the assumption of slowly fluctuating,
   inhomogeneous, magnetic patches with increasing volume fraction as the
   temperature decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large effective
   magnetization can be easily introduced by the application of moderate
   magnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for
   proximity coupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a
   heterostructure with transition-metal-doped layers. However, the
   introduction of some charge carriers by the Dy dopants cannot be
   excluded at least in these highly doped samples. Nevertheless, we find
   that the magnetic order is not mediated via the conduction channel in
   these samples and therefore magnetic order and carrier concentration are
   expected to be independently controllable. This is not generally the
   case for transition-metal-doped topological insulators, and Dy doping
   should thus allow for improved TI quantum devices.}},

   recently attracted much attention as a possible host for correlated
   topological surface states. Here, we use a combination of x-ray
   absorption and reflectometry techniques, backed up with a theoretical
   model for the resonant M-4,M-5 absorption edge of Sm and photoemission
   data, to establish laterally averaged chemical and valence depth
   profiles at the surface of SmB6. We show that upon cleaving, the highly
   polar (001) surface of SmB6 undergoes substantial chemical and valence
   reconstruction, resulting in boron termination and a Sm3+ dominated
   subsurface region. Whereas at room temperature, the reconstruction
   occurs on a timescale of less than 2 h, it takes about 24 h below 50 K.
   The boron termination is eventually established, irrespective of the
   initial termination. Our findings reconcile earlier depth resolved
   photoemission and scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies performed at
   different temperatures and are important for better control of surface

   properties emerge from the coupling between the phases, but the strength
   of this coupling depends on the quality of the interfaces. Atomic
   control of crystalline interfaces is notoriously complicated and to
   elude that obstacle, we suggest here an all-amorphous design. Starting
   from a model amorphous iron alloy, we locally tune the magnetic behavior
   by creating boron-doped regions by means of ion implantation through a
   lithographic mask. This process preserves the amorphous environment,
   creating a non-topographic magnetic superstructure with smooth
   interfaces and no structural discontinuities. The absence of
   inhomogeneities acting as pinning centers for the magnetization reversal
   is demonstrated by the formation of magnetic vortexes for ferromagnetic
   disks as large as 20 mu m in diameter embedded within a paramagnetic
   matrix. Rigid exchange coupling between two amorphous ferromagnetic
   phases in a microstructured sample is evidenced by an investigation
   involving first-order reversal curves. The sample consists of a soft
   matrix with embedded elements constituting a hard phase where the
   anisotropy originates from an elongated shape of the elements. We
   provide an intuitive explanation for the micrometer-range exchange

   the incorporation of sputtering gas particles (Ar) in the Ge layer gives
   rise to a marked reduction in the neutron scattering length density

   shown that the implantation of primary Ar ions backscattered at the
   target is responsible for the incorporation of Ar particles and that the
   fraction increases with increasing ion incidence angle and increasing
   polar emission angle. This leads to a possibility of fine-tuning of the
   SLD for the IBS, which is required to realize a high polarization
   efficiency of a neutron polarizing supermirror. Fe/Ge polarizing
   supermirror with m = 5 fabricated under the same condition showed a
   spin-up reflectivity of 0.70 at the critical momentum transfer. The
   polarization was higher than 0.985 for the q(2). range where the

   artificial magnetic honeycomb lattice is a strongly debated issue. While
   theoretical researches suggest that the system will develop a novel zero
   entropy spin solid state as T -> 0 K, a confirmation to this effect in
   artificial honeycomb lattice of connected elements is lacking. This
   study reports on the investigation of magnetic correlation in newly
   designed artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice of ultrasmall elements,
   with a typical length of approximate to 12 nm, using neutron scattering
   measurements and temperature-dependent micromagnetic simulations.
   Numerical modeling of the polarized neutron reflectometry data
   elucidates the temperature-dependent evolution of spin correlation in
   this system. As temperature reduces to approximate to 7 K, the system
   tends to develop novel spin solid state, manifested by the alternating
   distribution of magnetic vortex loops of opposite chiralities.
   Experimental results are complemented by temperature-dependent
   micromagnetic simulations that confirm the dominance of spin solid state
   over local magnetic charge ordered state in the artificial honeycomb
   lattice with connected elements. These results enable a direct
   investigation of novel spin solid correlation in the connected honeycomb
   geometry of 2D artificial structure.}},

   Returning to open circuit potential leaves the surface in a persistent

   and magnetic properties versus n have been studied. Elemental layering
   can be seen with transmission electron microscopy down to n = 4 ML layer
   thickness, although an intermixed region characterized by a finite
   interface width is found to be present. This width is composed of the
   interface roughness as well as the interdiffusion between layers, but
   the relative contributions from these two sources could not be concluded
   by the techniques used. The measured elemental layering and X-ray
   reflectivity (XRR) give an upper limit to the interface width which must
   be smaller than the thinnest layers, 4 ML. Electron energy loss
   spectroscopy (EELS), depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and also XRR reveal that Fe has a higher tendency to mix with Ni
   than vice versa. XPS does not have the resolution to measure this thin
   elemental layering: composition variations for n = 8 ML which are
   clearly seen by EELS are barely resolved by XPS. The structure was
   determined by X-ray diffraction, and an epitaxial fcc (001) structure is
   found to be maintained throughout the multilayers up to n less than or
   similar to 8 ML. For larger n values, relaxation starts by Fe-fcc(001)
   layers changing into Fe-bcc(110), which is then followed by Ni-fcc(001)
   changing from (001) to (111) orientation along the growth direction. A
   decreased total measured magnetic moment for the fully epitaxial
   multilayers can be explained by the fcc Fe layers being partly
   anti-ferromagnetic, whereas the relaxed multilayers exhibit the expected
   magnetic properties of (bcc Fe) +(fcc Ni).}},

   ultra high vacuum, much less is known about the interaction between
   water and RuO2 in aqueous solution. In this work, in situ surface X-ray
   scattering measurements combined with density functional theory (DFT)
   were used to determine the surface structural changes on single-crystal
   RuO2(110) as a function of potential in acidic electrolyte. The redox
   peaks at 0.7, 1.1 and 1.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
   could be attributed to surface transitions associated with the
   successive deprotonation of -H2O on the coordinatively unsaturated Ru
   sites (CUS) and hydrogen adsorbed to the bridging oxygen sites. At
   potentials relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an -OO
   species on the Ru CUS sites was detected, which was stabilized by a
   neighboring -OH group on the Ru CUS or bridge site. Combining
   potential-dependent surface structures with their energetics from DFT
   led to a new OER pathway, where the deprotonation of the -OH group used
   to stabilize -OO was found to be rate-limiting.}},

   intricately linked to the concentration of interstitial O atoms within
   the structure and the oxidation state of U. We have previously shown
   that, during corrosion of the UO2 (111) surface under either 1 atm of
   O-2 gas or oxygenated water at room temperature, oxygen interstitials
   diffuse into the substrate to form a superlattice with three-layer
   periodicity. In the current study, we present results from surface X-ray
   scattering that reveal the structure of the oxygen diffusion profile
   beneath the (001) surface. The first few layers below the surface
   oscillate strongly in their surface -normal lattice parameters,
   suggesting preferential interstitial occupation of every other layer
   below the surface, which is geometrically consistent with the
   interstitial network that forms below the oxidized (111) surface. Deeper
   layers are heavily contracted and indicate that the oxidation front
   penetrates similar to 52 angstrom below the (001) surface after 21 days

   exploited to make resonators and filters in microwave devices, but it
   also has the lowest magnetic damping of any known material. In this
   article we describe the structural and magnetic properties of single
   crystal thin-film YIG where the temperature dependence of the
   magnetisation reveals a decrease in the low temperature region. In order
   to understand this complex material we bring a large number of
   structural and magnetic techniques to bear on the same samples. Through
   a comprehensive analysis we show that at the substrate -YIG interface,
   an interdiffusion zone of only 4-6 nm exists. Due to the interdiffusion
   of Y from the YIG and Gd from the substrate, an addition magnetic layer
   is formed at the interface whose properties are crucially important in
   samples with a thickness of YIG less than 200 nm.}},

   interface. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) was used to give depth

   compositionally distinct thin layer near the surface. We theorize that
   the bottom layer, which is independent of the film thickness, is caused
   by Gd diffusion. The top layer is likely to be extremely important in
   inverse spin Hall effect measurements, and is most likely Y2O3 or very

   At heterointerfaces, these interactions may be enhanced by combining
   oxides where the polarity changes at the interface. The physical
   structure between nonpolar SrTiO3 and polar La1-x Sr-x MnO3 (x = 0.2) is
   investigated using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction to
   directly determine the role of structural distortions in compensating
   the polar discontinuity. At both the oxide-oxide interface and
   vacuum-oxide interfaces, the lattice is found to expand and rumple along
   the growth direction. The SrTiO3/La1-x Sr-x MnO3 interface also exhibits
   intermixing of La and Sr over a few unit cells. The results thus
   demonstrate that polar distortions and ionic intermixing coexist and
   both pathways play a significant role at interfaces with polar

   correlations in condensed matter systems leads to a rich array of
   phenomena, such as magnetism, superconductivity, and novel conduction
   mechanisms. While such phenomena are observed in bulk materials, a
   richer array of behaviors becomes possible when these degrees of freedom
   are controlled in atomically layered heterostructures, where one can
   constrain dimensionality and impose interfacial boundary conditions.
   Here, we unlock a host of unique, hidden electronic and magnetic phase
   transitions in NdNiO3 while approaching the two-dimensional (2D) limit,
   resulting from the differing influences of dimensional confinement and
   interfacial coupling. Most notably, we discover a phase in fully 2D,
   single-layer NdNiO3, in which all signatures of the bulk magnetic and
   charge ordering are found to vanish. In addition, for
   quasi-two-dimensional layers down to a thickness of two unit cells,
   bulk-type ordering persists but separates from the onset of insulating
   behavior in a manner distinct from that found in the bulk or thin-film
   nickelates. Using resonant x-ray spectroscopies, first-principles
   theory, and model calculations, we propose that the single-layer phase
   suppression results from an alternative mechanism of interfacial
   electronic reconstruction based on ionicity differences across the
   interface, while the phase separation in multilayer NdNiO3 emerges due
   to enhanced 2D fluctuations. These findings provide insights into the
   intertwined mechanisms of charge and spin ordering in strongly
   correlated systems in reduced dimensions and illustrate the ability to
   use atomic layering to access hidden phases.}},

   semiconductors, by alternating the under-potential deposition (UPD) of

   well ordered layered crystal structure made on alternating

   the film morphology and optical properties, complex synthesis processes
   which include multiple steps-i. e., film deposition followed by
   post-deposition treatment by thermal or laser annealing-are commonly

   single-step synthesis process that is based on modulating the arrival
   pattern of film forming species with sub-monolayer resolution, while
   keeping the amount of Ag in the films constant. Our data indicate that

   at about half of the thickness (similar to 1.7 nm) for low-O conditions
   due to less oxidative conditions and less energetic particles arriving
   at the sample, which leads to less intermixing via silicate formation.
   In contrast, for high-O conditions, there is more ZrSiO4 and/or SiOx
   formation, giving more intermixing (similar to 3.4 nm). In vacuo X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements revealed similar
   stoichiometric ZrO2 layers deposited by both conditions and a higher

   modulations increases. However, the extra layer of water modulation
   reduces the surface roughness drastically and also improves the
   electrical properties as compared to the unmodulated ZnO films. Water
   modulation is believed to serve as a source of atomic oxygen that
   promotes compensation of the pre-existing oxygen vacancies. The films

   pressure raising from 0\% to 100\%, the film growth rate decreased from

   in the catalytic and geochemical behavior of metal oxides. In a vast
   majority of studies, the interfacial structure is assumed to arise from
   a relatively static lowest energy configuration of atoms, even at room
   temperature. Using hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as a model oxide, we show
   through a direct comparison of in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering with
   density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations that the
   structure of the (1 (1) over bar 02) termination is dynamically
   stabilized by picosecond water exchange. Simulations show frequent
   exchanges between terminal aquo groups and adsorbed water in locations
   and with partial residence times consistent with experimentally
   determined atomic sites and fractional occupancies. Frequent water
   exchange occurs even for an ultrathin adsorbed water film persisting on
   the surface under a dry atmosphere. The resulting time averaged
   interfacial structure consists of a ridged lateral arrangement of
   adsorbed water molecules hydrogen bonded to terminal aquo groups.
   Surface pK(a) prediction based on bond valence analysis suggests that
   water exchange will influence the proton-transfer reactions underlying
   the acid/base reactivity at the interface. Our findings provide

   trimethyl-n-hexylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (TMHATFSI)

   at solid-liquid interface. Electrochemical measurements using an
   electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) identified a
   reduction peak corresponding to Si electrodeposition and several
   elementary steps with stable intermediates forming prior to the
   deposition. For detailed analysis, X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements
   with synchrotron radiation were applied in situ. The change in
   reflectivity of the electrode surface during the deposition was found to
   be due to the formation of a polymer-like Si such as Si2Cl6, which is an
   intermediate layer during the deposition process. These results were
   theoretically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations:
   after an electron transfers from the electrode, the Si in SiCl4 forms
   the bond with another SiCl4, rather than the Si of the substrate,
   resulting in the formation of the intermediate structure. These data
   suggest an elementary step in the SiCl4 reduction process which can be
   described as follows; when SiCl4 is reduced, a polymer-like Si form such
   as Si2Cl6 is generated. This intermediate species further reacts with
   other Si reactants after receiving additional electrons, which then
   finally deposits as Si on the substrate. (c) The Author(s) 2017.

   light and heavy water solutions, Ni oxidation and passive film formation
   occurred at the same potential with similar passive current densities
   indicating a minor isotope effect of deuterium on passive film formation
   and growth. Polarized neutron reflectometry detected a passive film
   growth coefficient of 11.5 +/- 1.1 angstrom/V. The Ni consumption
   coefficient was determined to be 7.3 +/- 1.5 angstrom/V. Ni oxidation
   and passive film growth occurred mostly during the transient period
   after the applied potential increase but was negligible at the steady
   state. The electric field strength across the passive film was 8 x 106
   V/cm. The Pilling-Bedworth ratio of the passive film during
   potentiostatic growth was close to the value of NiO grown on bulk Ni.
   This work demonstrated the capability of neutron reflectometry in the

   backscattering, together with impedance spectroscopy. The obtained
   proton conductivity and activation energy are comparable to literature
   values for the bulk conductivity of similar materials, thus showing that
   grain-boundary conductivity is negligible due to the high crystallinity
   of the film. The results reveal an uneven proton concentration depth
   profile, with the presence of a 3-4 nm thick, proton-rich layer with
   altered composition, likely characterized by cationic deficiency. While
   this surface layer either retains or reobtains protons after desorption
   and cooling to room temperature, the bulk of the film absorbs and
   desorbs protons in the expected mariner. It is suggested that the
   protons in the near-surface, proton rich region are located in proton
   sites characterized by relatively strong O-H bonds due to weak
   hydrogen-bond interactions to neighboring oxygen atoms and that the
   mobility of protons in these sites is generally lower than in proton

   hundreds of nanometers on neighboring terraces. We attribute the
   nonuniform thickness to step depairing during the thin film deposition

   layers and interfaces in ultrathin films because of its ability to probe
   the electron density profile along the depth in a non-destructive
   manner. While routine X-ray reflectivity assumes the in-plane uniformity
   of the sample to be measured, it is also quite important to see buried
   inhomogeneous/patterned layers and interfaces. The present paper
   describes the addition of spatial resolution and imaging capability to
   an X-ray reflectivity technique to visualize surfaces and buried
   interfaces. To visualize quite wide viewing area size quickly, the image
   reconstruction scheme has been employed instead of the scanning of
   microbeam. Though the mathematics is quite close to X-ray computer
   tomography, the technique gives the image contrast caused by the
   difference in reflectivity at each in-plane point in the thin film
   sample. By choosing a grazing angle, the image gives inhomogeneity of
   X-ray reflectivity at the specific wavevector transfer. With a
   collimated monochromatic synchrotron X-ray beam of 0.05mm (H) x 8mm (V),
   the intensity profiles of X-ray reflection projections have been taken
   at many different in-plane rotation angles, from 0 degrees to 180
   degrees. We have succeeded in visualizing buried layers and interfaces
   of the 8mm dia area with the spatial resolution of better than 20 mu m.
   Because of the brilliance of synchrotron radiation, the typical
   measuring time is shorter than 1min. Three analytical cases have been
   discussed: (i) imaging of a buried layer and an interface covered by a
   protection layer, (ii) distinguishing different local parts of different
   thicknesses in an ultrathin film, and (iii) selective imaging of a

   heterostructures and electronics. This has naturally focused attention
   on growth, stoichiometry, and defects in SrTiO3, one exciting recent
   development being such precisely stoichiometric defect-managed thin
   films that electron mobilities have finally exceeded bulk crystals. This
   has been achieved only by molecular beam epitaxy, however (and to a

   transport. We find that this form of sputter deposition is also capable
   of homoepitaxy of precisely stoichiometric SrTiO3, but only provided
   that substrate and target preparation, temperature, pressure, and
   deposition rate are carefully controlled. Even under these conditions,
   oxygen-vacancy-doped heteroepitaxial SrTiO3 films are found to have

   variety of complementary techniques, namely, x-ray diffraction (XRD),
   atomic force microscopy, SQUID magnetometry, magneto-transport, and
   polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR). It is found that the samples
   retain good crystalline order up to a doping level of x = 0.42 (in
   CrxSb2-xTe3), above which degradation of the crystal structure is
   observed by XRD. Fits to the recorded XRD spectra indicate a general
   reduction in the c-axis lattice parameter as a function of doping,
   consistent with substitutional doping with an ion of smaller ionic
   radius. The samples show soft ferromagnetic behavior with the easy axis
   of magnetization being out-of-plane. The saturation magnetization is
   dependent on the doping level, and reaches from similar to 2 mu B to
   almost 3 mu B per Cr ion. The transition temperature (T-c) depends
   strongly on the Cr concentration and is found to increase with doping
   concentration. For the highest achievable doping level for phase-pure
   films of x = 0.42, a T-c of 125K was determined. Electric transport
   measurements find surface-dominated transport below similar to 10K. The
   magnetic properties extracted from anomalous Hall effect data are in
   excellent agreement with the magnetometry data. PNR studies indicate a
   uniform magnetization profile throughout the film, with no indication of

   we studied how the magnetic proximity effect at the interface between
   the cuprate high-T-C superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and the ferromagnet
   La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) is related to the electronic and magnetic
   properties of the LCMO layers. In particular, we explored how the
   magnitude of the ferromagnetic Cu moment on the YBCO side depends on the
   strength of the antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange coupling with the Mn
   moment on the LCMO side. We found that the Cu moment remains sizable if
   the AF coupling with the Mn moments is strongly reduced or even entirely
   suppressed. The ferromagnetic order of the Cu moments thus seems to be
   intrinsic to the interfacial CuO2 planes and related to a weakly
   ferromagnetic intraplanar exchange interaction. The latter is discussed
   in terms of the partial occupation of the Cu 3d(3z2)-r(2) orbitals,
   which occurs in the context of the so-called orbital reconstruction of
   the interfacial Cu ions.}},

   commensurate with the observed periodicity of 0-pi crossovers, the

   Zr-doping enhances the crystallization temperature and thermal stability
   of Sb2Te alloy effectively. Crystalline Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) film is
   manifested as a single phase without phase separation and the growth of
   crystal grain is dramatically suppressed. The density change of
   Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) material between amorphous and crystalline is similar to
   2.65 +/- 0.03\%, which is much smaller than that of Ge2Sb2Te5 (6.5\%).
   Phase change memory cells based on Zr-2(Sb2Te)(98) material can be
   reversibly switched by applying 40-400 ns width voltage pulses, and the
   reset current is relatively small when comparing with the prototypical
   Ge2Sb2Sb5 material. The resistance ON-OFF ratio of about 1.3 orders of
   magnitude is enough for figuring ``0{''} and ``1{''} out. Besides,

   reflectivity with momentum transfer. We now hypothesize that this effect
   is attributable to an optical distortion caused by the liquid's meniscus
   near the container wall. The validity of this idea is tested and
   confirmed through a subsidiary experiment on a D2O sample, showing that
   the meniscus can significantly distort results if the beam size in the
   horizontal plane is comparable with, or bigger than, the diameter of the
   container. The meniscus problem can be eliminated if the beam size is
   substantially smaller than the diameter of the container, such that
   reflection takes place only from the flat region of the liquid surface
   thus excluding the meniscus tails. Practical measures for minimizing the
   meniscus distortion effect are discussed. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

   studied with increasing nonmagnetic (NM) heavy-metal layer thicknesses
   in the range 0.2 nm <= t(NM) <= 10 nm, where t(NM) is the NM layer
   thickness. Magnetization precession was measured in the time domain
   using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry. Fitting of
   the data with a damped sinusoidal function was undertaken in order to
   extract the phenomenological Gilbert damping coefficient a. For
   Pt-capped Co and Ni81Fe19 layers a large and complex dependence of a on
   the Pt layer thickness was observed, while for Au capping no significant
   dependence was observed. It is suggested that this difference is related
   to the different localized spin-orbit interaction related to intermixing
   and to alpha hybridization of Pt and Au at the interface with Co or
   Ni81Fe19. Also it was shown that damping is affected by the crystal
   structure differences in FM thin films and at the interface, which can
   modify the spin-diffusion length and the effective spin-mixing
   conductance. In addition to the intrinsic damping an extrinsic
   contribution plays an important role in the enhancement of damping when

   spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure static optical
   properties, revealing a linear increase in absorption coefficient at
   1.25 eV and a red-shifting of the optical absorption edge with
   increasing Sr fraction. The absorption spectra can be similarly tuned

   role that nominal Fe valence plays in optical absorption. Dynamic
   optoelectronic properties were studied with ultrafast transient
   reflectance spectroscopy, revealing similar nanosecond photoexcited

Both tensile (of about similar to 6% caused by the MgO substrate) and compressive (of about similar to 1% caused by the SrTiO3 substrate) strains reduce the bulk metal-to-insulator phase transition temperature of the La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 layer from 240 K towards 195 K and 160 K, respectively. The appearance of the effect of colossal electroresistance, linear and nonlinear current-voltage behaviours and contribution of FE polarization switching in the BaTiO3 layer to the conductivity are associated with the influence of epitaxial strain. The predominance of the compressive over the tensile strain leads to the hysteresis behaviour of electroresistance, maximum conductivity caused by the resonant-tunnelling mechanism, and strong nonlinear optical dependence on the applied electric field.},

The N-2 partial gas flow (RN2) was varied in close intervals to achieve the optimum conditions for the growth of the tetra cobalt nitride (Co4N) phase. We found that Co-N films grown using the HiPIMS process adopt (111) orientation as compared to the growth taking place along the (100) direction in the dcMS process. It was observed that HiPIMS grown Co-N films were superior in terms of crystallite size and uniform surface morphology. The local structure of films was investigated using x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. We found that the high energy of adatoms in the HiPIMS technique assisted in the more excellent stabilization of fcc-Co and the novel Co4N phase relative to the dcMS process. Magnetic properties of Co-N thin films were studied using magneto-optical Kerr effect, vibrating sample magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectivity. It was found that though the saturation magnetization remains almost similar in films grown by dcMS or HiPIMS processes, they differ in terms of their magnetic anisotropy. Such variation can be understood in terms of differences in the growth mechanisms in dcMS and HiPIMS processes affecting the resulting Co4N phase's local structure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

While blending with inorganic counterparts is considered a good strategy to further improve polymeric TE properties, only a few attempts succeed so far due to inhomogeneous embedding and the non-ideal organic-inorganic contact. Here a new strategy to include nanoparticles (NPs) without any ligand termination inside PEDOT:PSS thin films is proposed. Spark discharge-generated tin oxide NPs (SnOx-NPs) are "gently" and homogenously deposited through low-energy diffusion mode. Strong interaction between naked SnOx-NPs and PSS chains occurs in the topmost layer, causing a structural reorganization towards an improved PEDOT chains crystalline packing at the bottom, providing a positive contribution to the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, dedoping and energy filtering effect introduced by the SnOx-NPs cause dramatic Seebeck coefficient enhancement. The optimized power factor of 116 mu Wm(-1) K-2 achieved is more than six times higher than the value found for the film without NPs. This easy and efficient strategy promises well for future mass production of flexible TE devices and the mechanism revealed may inspire future research on TEs and flexible electronics.},

Here, we showed that on RuO2(110) in alkaline solutions, OER activity is cation-dependent, being largest in 0.1 M KOH compared to LiOH and NaOH. Using crystal truncation rod analysis, -O is detected on the coordinatively unsaturated site at 1.5 V-RHE in 0.1 M KOH, suggesting that the rate-determining step is -O + OH- -> -OOH + e(-), which is different from that in acid involving the final deprotonation of -OOH. The ordering of interfacial water in base was found to decrease with increasing potential and independent of cations. Using surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, the density of isolated water molecules (zero H-bonds) was found to increase, and the density of icelike water molecules (four H-bonds) decreases from Li+ to K+ at OER potentials. The higher activity of more isolated interfacial OH - ions in the case of K+ and the lesser stabilization of -O intermediates by hydration water of K+ compared to Na+ and Li+ can result in higher OER activity for KOH. This work provides molecular details of the interface as a function of potential and electrolyte and enables the design of more active electrochemical interfaces.},

In this work, epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111) films were fabricated to investigate the spin-pumping efficiency and spin-orbit torque efficiency by ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall resistance measurement techniques, respectively. Ferromagnetic resonance results show that the incremental magnetic damping constants in epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111), compared with those of the epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/AlOx reference sample, depend on whether the external magnetic field is applied along the in-plane easy or hard axes of Fe0.79Si0.21. The Pt thickness-dependent anisotropic damping constant was ascribed to the anisotropic spin current absorption in epitaxial Pt(111) layer. When electric currents were applied along the easy and hard axes of Fe0.79Si0.21 in epitaxial Fe0.79Si0.21(001)/Pt(111) bilayers, a large difference between spin-orbit torques generated from Pt(111) was observed by a harmonic Hall resistance measurement method. Both of the results suggest that spin current transmission efficiency is related to the anisotropic spin Hall effect of epitaxial Pt(111) layer due to the different spin-orbit interaction energies along the different crystallographic directions of Pt.},

  abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate an approach for improving ferroelectric properties of La:HfO2 thin films by shifting the grain growth regime toward heterogeneous nucleation. A dilute 0.083 M instead of a 0.25 M solution together with an annealing step after every spin-coating cycle film gives rise to a significant improvement of ferroelectric properties. While a remanent polarization of 7 mu C/cm(2) was found for randomly oriented conventional films, the value of 15 mu C/cm(2) for the dilute solution is a result of a mixed 111 and 002 preferential orientation. A more than 50% improved breakdown voltage stems from a global density improvement from 8.0 to 8.4g/cm(3) as obtained from x-ray reflectivity (XRR). We also find superstructure peaks in XRR hinting on periodic alternations of the local density throughout the film thickness. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry confirm this periodicity. The sensitivity of XRR for this periodicity was leveraged to gain further insights in the origin of this superstructure with additional experiments. We conclude that both orientation and the superstructure are caused by a "layered structure" according to Schuler's microstructural zone model. However, our data also provide evidence for parallel chemical effects of cap formation in each stacked sub-layer. While this work shows a significant enhancement of ferroelectric properties, it also provides insights into further optimization potential of solution deposition of HfO2/ZrO2 thin films. Our XRR-based approach supplemented with suitable additional analysis can be of great value for the optimization of other solution-derived thin films beyond the material class studied here.},

The anionic surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was shown to be able to remove the cationic layer, but only if anionic micelles were present in solution. To facilitate comparison with the behaviour of a non-ionic surfactant, the direct adsorption of pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E5) to mica was also studied; low surface coverage adsorption was seen at the critical micelle concentration and above. C12E5 was then found not to remove the cationic layer, but did include into the layer to some degree. The presence of cationic surfactant on the mica was however shown to significantly modify the adsorption behaviour of the non-ionic surfactant. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, the authors investigate a superconductor/molecule/normal metal heterostructure and demonstrate spin-ordering and proximity induced superconducting properties at the metallo-molecular interface. Combining magnetic and superconducting functionalities enables lower energy spin transfer and magnetic switching in quantum computing and information storage, owing to the dissipationless nature of quasi-particle mediated supercurrents. Here, we put forward a system where emergent spin-ordering and diffusion of Cooper pairs are achieved at a non-intrinsically magnetic nor superconducting metallo-molecular interface. Electron transport, magnetometry and low-energy muon spin rotation are used to probe time-reversal symmetry breaking in these structures. By comparing the Meissner expulsion in a system including a Cu/C-60 spin-converter interface to one without, we observe a paramagnetic contribution that can be explained due to the conversion of spin-singlet Cooper pair states into odd-frequency triplet states. These results demonstrate the potential of metallo-molecular interfaces to achieve singlet to triplet Cooper pair conversion, a capability not present in either metal or molecule separately that could be used in the generation and controlled diffusion of spin polarised dissipationless currents.},

  abstract = {We show that a trilayer magnetic structure, consisting of a heavy metal (Platinum) as a buffer, an ultrathin ferromagnet (Cobalt) as a functional layer, and an antiferromagnetic insulator (Nickel oxide, NixOy) as a capping, is a host of intriguing physical phenomena desirable for spintronics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed changes in the ratio of NixOy phases with different stoichiometry. Due to strong spin-orbit coupling, the Pt layer induces perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Co, breaks its structural inversion symmetry, and causes an additive effect of Pt/Co and Co/NixOy interfaces to the effective interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-eff). Manipulation the magnetic anisotropy can be realized by the ferromagnetic layer thickness variation and modification of the Co/NixOy interface. The NixOy capping layer induces the exchange bias in Co, which effective field vertical bar Beb vertical bar can be controlled in the range from 0 to 24 mT. The magnitude and direction of B-eb does not affect D-eff. The increase of Ar pressure leads to structural transformation of the Co/NixOy interface and, consequently, to decrease of the surface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (D-s), the source of which is the NiO phase. We demonstrate that the studied Pt/Co/NixOy system has a number of functional properties useful for future logic and memory applications.},

  abstract = {Magnetometry measurements of Fe/U and Ni/U bilayer systems reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the magnetic anisotropy for U thicknesses in the range of 0-8 nm with the Fe/U bilayers showing a more prominent effect as compared to Ni/U. The stronger response for Fe/U is ascribed to the stronger 3d-5f hybridization of Fe and U. This nonmonotonic behavior is thought to arise from quantum well states in the uranium overlayers. Estimating an oscillation period from the nonmonotonic data, and comparing it to Density Functional Theory calculations, we find that wave vector matches to the experimental data can be made to regions of high spectral density in (010) and (100) cuts of the electronic structure of a-U, consistent with the measured texture in the films. Unexpectedly, there are also indications of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a subset of Fe/U samples at relatively large U thickness.},

  abstract = {Anion ordering is a promising route to engineer physical properties in functional heteroanionic materials. A central challenge in the study of anion-ordered compounds lies in developing robust synthetic strategies to control anion occupation and in understanding the resultant implications for electronic structure. Here, we show that epitaxial strain induces preferential occupation of F and O on the anion-sites in perovskite oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-delta F gamma films grown on different substrates. Under compressive strain, F tends to occupy the apical-like sites, which was revealed by F and O K-edge linearly polarized X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, resulting in an enhanced c-axis expansion. Under tensile strain, F tends to occupy the equatorial-like sites, enabling the longer Mn-F bonds to lie within the plane. The oxyfluoride films exhibit a significant orbital polarization of the 3d electrons, distinct F-site dependence to their valence band density of states, and an enhanced resistivity when F occupies the apical-like anion-site compared to the equatorial-like site. By demonstrating a general strategy for inducing preferential anion-site occupancy in oxyfluoride perovskites, this work lays the foundation for future materials design and synthesis efforts that leverage this greater degree of atomic control to realize new polar or quasi-two-dimensional materials.},

Nanoconfinement of the Ta1-yPdy layer suppresses the first-order phase transitions present in bulk and ensures a sensing response free of any hysteresis. Unlike other sensing materials, Ta1-yPdy features the special property that the sensing range can be easily tuned by varying the Pd concentration without a reduction of the sensitivity of the sensing material.

Magnetic properties of the films were probed via superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. It was demonstrated that due to the hydrogen bonding between P4VP and PAA, the Fe3O4@PAA NPs segregate selectively inside P4VP domains, enhancing the microphase separation process. This in turn, together with employing carefully optimized dip-coating parameters, results in the formation of hybrid thin films with highly ordered nanostructures. The addition of Fe3O4@PAA nanoparticles does not change the average interdomain spacing in the film lateral nanostructure. Moreover, it was shown that the nanoparticles can easily be removed to obtain well-ordered nanoporous templates.},

The structural analysis confirmed the intermixing at interfaces of the Ti and TbFe layer with the increment of UL thicknesses. Out-of-plane (OOP) coercivity (H-c), and saturation field (H-s) gradually increased with an increase in UL thickness. For UL = 10 nm, the domain contrast and OOP stray field strength were enhanced, which may be due to the extent of d-d hybridization dominated over the influence of interfacial roughness. While for UL = 20, and 40 nm, the extent of interfacial roughness dominated the hybridization effects. In the case of UL: 20 nm, H-c increased by nearly 6 times more than the bare TbFe system. We observed a state with high OOP Hc combined with nearly zero OOP stray fields that are found to coexist in the sample. The magnetization reversal studies on a large area reveal domain nucleation followed by domain wall motion in all the films. The idea of tuning magnetic properties by varying thicknesses of Ti UL may be useful in spintronics applications.},

Further supporting techniques such as XRR, TEM, WAXS, and AFM were employed to develop an extensive microstructural understanding of the multilayer before and during heating. It was found that the pronounced in-plane compressive residual stress and defect population induced by ion beam deposition result in low thermal stability driven by thermally activated self-interstitial and vacancy diffusion, ultimately leading to complete degradation of the layered structure at moderate temperatures. The formation of Cu protrusions was observed, and a model was formulated for stress-assisted Cu diffusion driven by Coble creep along W grain boundaries, along with the interaction with Si substrate, which showed excellent agreement with the observed experimental data. The model provided the explanation for the experimentally observed strong correlation between thin film deposition conditions, microstructural properties, and low thermal stability that can be applied to other multilayer systems.},

DWs interact stochastically at ring junctions to create mechanisms of DW population loss and gain. These combine to give a dynamic, field-dependent equilibrium DW population that is a robust and emergent property of the array, despite highly varied local magnetic configurations. The magnetic ring arrays' properties (e.g., non-linear behavior, "fading memory" to changes in field, fabrication repeatability, and scalability) suggest they are an interesting candidate system for realizing reservoir computing (RC), a form of neuromorphic computing, in hardware.

  abstract = {The nature of an interfacial structure buried within a device assembly is often critical to its function. For example, the dye/TiO2 interfacial structure that comprises the working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) governs its photovoltaic output. These structures have been determined outside of the DSC device, using ex situ characterization methods; yet, they really should be probed while held within a DSC since they are modulated by the device environment. Dye/TiO2 structures will be particularly influenced by a layer of electrolyte ions that lies above the dye self-assembly. We show that electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfacial structures can be resolved using in situ neutron reflectometry with contrast matching. We find that electrolyte constituents ingress into the self-assembled monolayer of dye molecules that anchor onto TiO2. Some dye/TiO2 anchoring configurations are modulated by the formation of electrolyte/dye intermolecular interactions. These electrolyte-influencing structural changes will affect dye-regeneration and electron-injection DSC operational processes. This underpins the importance of this in situ structural determination of electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfaces within representative DSC device environments.},

Due to the large film-substrate lattice mismatch, strain relaxation is found to occur within the first 2-3 unit cells (uc) of the film as evidenced by reflection high energy electron diffraction and high-resolution synchrotron x-ray reciprocal space mapping. We find that the presence of the LSCO spacer and capping layers leads to ferromagnetism in ultra-thin LSMO layers with thicknesses of the order of 2 uc with the magnetic easy axis oriented in the film plane.

Successful epitaxial growth along this direction has so far been limited to thin film deposition techniques involving a relatively high kinetic energy, specifically pulsed laser deposition and sputtering. Here, we report on the self-regulated growth of [111]-oriented high-quality SrVO3 by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. The favorable growth kinetics available for the growth of perovskite oxides by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy on non-polar surfaces was also present for the growth of [111]-oriented films, resulting in high-quality SrVO3(111) thin films with residual resistivity ratios exceeding 20.

In this work, Permalloy/SrIrO3/Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)(0.7) Ti0.3O3 (Py/SIO/PMNPT) heterostructures were prepared by pulsed laser deposition of SIO thin films epitaxially on (001)-oriented single crystalline PMNPT substrates, followed by sputter deposition of Py films upon SIO through a shadow mask. The paramagnetic SIO layer, with a large spin-orbit coupling, serves as a detector to check the spin current pumped from the adjacent ferromagnetic Py layer through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). It is observed that the spin pumping amplitude can be reversibly tuned by about 50% through applying a 10kV/cm electric field on the piezoelectric PMNPT substrate. The ISHE voltage shows a butterfly hysteresis resembling the strain-field curve of PMNPT, indicating the relevance of strain coupling at the SIO/PMNPT interface. In situ x-ray diffraction reveals that both in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters of SIO vary with the field applied on PMNPT. These results highlight that SIO is a promising candidate material for spin detection, and the efficiency of spin to charge conversion in SIO can be tuned electrically in SIO/PMNPT heterostructures.},

  abstract = {Many polymorphic crystal structures of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) have been reported over the past few decades, but despite its manifold applicability, the structure of the frequently mentioned alpha polymorph remained unclear. The base-centered unit cell (space group C2/c) suggested in 1966 was ruled out in 2003 and was replaced by a primitive triclinic unit cell (space group P (1) over bar). This study proves unequivocally that both alpha structures coexist in vacuum-deposited CuPc thin films on native silicon oxide by reciprocal space mapping using synchrotron radiation in grazing incidence. The unit-cell parameters and the space group were determined by kinematic scattering theory and provide possible molecular arrangements within the unit cell of the C2Ic structure by excluded-volume considerations. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments and ex situ atomic force microscopy complement the experimental data further and provide insight into the formation of a smooth thin film by a temperature-driven downward diffusion of CuPc molecules during growth.},

  abstract = {Nanoscale Ru/C multilayers are essential reflective optics in the hard x-ray region of 7-20 keV. To understand the layer growth behavior and develop ultrathin Ru/C multilayer mirrors with periods smaller than 3.0 nm, multilayers with different periods of 6.2-1.5 nm were fabricated and studied. It is found that the average interface width started to increase obviously when the period became smaller than 2.5 nm while the surface roughness of different multilayers remained almost the same. The intrinsic stress of the multilayer gradually decreased with decreasing period and reached a very low value of -82 MPa at d = 2.3 nm. High reflectance of 54% and 65% (at E = 8.04 keV) were demonstrated for the multilayers with periods of 2.5 nm and 3.0 nm, respectively, whereas that for 1.9 nm period was significantly lower. To further analyze the layer microstructure, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used. The polycrystallized structure of Ru remained similar for the multilayers with period less than 2.5 nm, while a non-continuous layer growth and severe intermixing between Ru and C were observed for the multilayer with period of 1.9 nm. The increased intermixing between Ru and C was found to be the main reason for the larger interface width and lower reflectance of the multilayers with period smaller than 2.5 nm. It also indicated that the layer thickness threshold for a Ru/C multilayer growing with good layer quality is 1.0-1.2 nm.},

  abstract = {Combustion synthesis is a well-known method for synthesis of transparent metal oxide thin films at low temperature (<400 <degrees>C). However, their functional properties are often inferior due to high residual porosity originating from a release of large amounts of gaseous products during combustion reaction. In this paper, indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive oxide thin films are prepared through combustion synthesis at 350 degrees C and the porosity issue is explored via multilayer deposition. When the thickness of individual layers is downscaled from 12 to 3 nm, the density increases from 5.8 to 7.0 g cm(-3) and porosity decreases from 20 to 3%. This causes a strong boost of conductivity sigma (f) from 220 to 620 S cm(-1), the latter being one of the highest values ever reported for low-temperature processed ITO films. The effectiveness of this approach is attributed to a large specific surface area of thinner individual layers, which strongly enhances gas transport during the combustion process. We also show that improved crystallinity and a strong increase in tensile in-plane stress strongly contribute to the boost in conductivity.},

The sequence of the magnetic switching in two of the samples (N = 4, N = 8) is determined using polarized neutron reflectometry. The outermost layers are shown to respond at the lowest fields, consistent with having the weakest interlayer exchange coupling.

  abstract = {Multilayer X-ray mirrors consist of a coating of a large number of alternate layers of high Z and low Z materials with a typical thickness of 10-100 angstrom, on a suitable substrate. Such coatings play an important role in enhancing the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors by allowing reflections at angles much larger than the critical angle of X-ray reflection for the given materials. Coating with an equal thickness of each bilayer (constant period multilayers) enhances the reflectivity at discrete energies, satisfying Bragg condition for the given thickness. However, by systematically varying the bilayer thickness in the multilayer stack (depth graded multilayers), it is possible to design X-ray mirrors having enhanced reflectivity over a broad energy range. One of the most important applications of such a depth graded multilayer mirror is to realize hard X-ray telescopes for astronomical purposes. Design of such multilayer X-ray mirrors and their characterization with X-ray reflectivity measurements require appropriate software tools that can compute X-ray reflectivity for the given set of parameters and geometry. We have initiated the development of hard X-ray optics for future Indian X-ray astronomical missions, and in this context, we have developed a program, DarpanX, to calculate X-ray reflectivity for single and multilayer mirrors. It can be used as a stand-alone tool for designing multilayer mirrors with required characteristics. But more importantly, it has been implemented as a local model for the popular X-ray spectral fitting program, XSPEC, and thus can be used for accurate fitting of the experimentally measured X-ray reflectivity data. DarpanX is implemented as a Python 3 module, and an API is provided to access the underlying algorithms. Here we present details of DarpanX implementation and its validation for different types of multilayer structures. We also demonstrate the model fitting capability of DarpanX for experimental X-ray reflectivity measurements of single and multilayer samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Of particular interest is the cubic Heusler compound Co2MnGa due to its inherent magnetic and topological properties. This work presents the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of magnetron co-sputtered Co2MnGa thin films, with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 80 nm. Polarized neutron reflectometry confirmed a uniform magnetization through the films. Hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a high degree of spin polarization and localized (itinerant) character of the Mn d (Co d) valence electrons and accompanying magnetic moments. Further, broadband and field orientation-dependent ferromagnetic resonance measurements indicated a relation between the thickness-dependent structural and magnetic properties. The increase of the tensile strain-induced tetragonal distortion in the thinner films was reflected in an increase of the cubic anisotropy term and a decrease of the perpendicular uniaxial term. The lattice distortion led to a reduction of the Gilbert damping parameter and the thickness-dependent film quality affected the inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. These experimental findings will enrich the understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetic Weyl semimetal thin films.},

A general increase in the reflectivity was observed after annealing at different temperatures from 300 to 700 degrees C, during which a maximum enhancement of around 14% was obtained at 600 degrees C. The highest reflectance measured at 8 keV reached 69% after 600 degrees C annealing. This was accompanied by a 6% expansion of the layer period, which could be mainly attributed to carbon layers. The surface roughness was not affected by the annealing, whereas the polycrystallization of Ru with crystallographic planes parallel to the layer interfaces was enhanced. Combining the transmission-electron microscopy measurements, it was found that the interdiffusion at the C-on-Ru interface was significantly suppressed. The decreased interdiffusion, enhanced optical contrast, and larger multilayer period were the main reasons for the increased reflectance. The 600 degrees C annealed Ru/C multilayer remained intact after 13 months of storage in air, which also demonstrated significant temporal stability.},

  abstract = {The influence of a carbon barrier layer to improve the reflectivity of Cr/Ti multilayers, intended to be used in the water window wavelength regime, is investigated. Specular grazing-incidence X-ray reflectivity results of Cr/Ti multilayers with 10 bilayers show that interface widths are reduced to similar to 0.24 nm upon introduction of a similar to 0.3 nm C barrier layer at each Cr-on-Ti interface. As the number of bilayers increases to 75, a multilayer with C barrier layers maintains almost the same interface widths with no cumulative increase in interface imperfections. Using such interface-engineered Cr/C/Ti multilayers, a remarkably high soft X-ray reflectivity of similar to 31.6% is achieved at a wavelength of 2.77 nm and at a grazing angle of incidence of 16.2 degrees, which is the highest reflectivity reported so far in the literature in this wavelength regime. Further investigation of the multilayers by diffused grazing-incidence X-ray reflectivity and grazing-incidence extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements using synchrotron radiation suggests that the improvement in interface microstructure can be attributed to significant suppression of inter-diffusion at Cr/Ti interfaces by the introduction of C barrier layers and also due to the smoothing effect of the C layer promoting two-dimensional growth of the multilayer.},

Oxidation half-cycles of 2-5min VUV/O-2 co-exposure are used to oxidize near-surface Ru to RuO2 at 1Torr O-2 and 100-150 degrees C. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate that RuO2 formation saturates after similar to 5min of VUV/O-2 exposure at 100 and 150 degrees C. The depth of Ru oxidation is limited by the rate of oxidation and can be controlled with substrate temperature and exposure time. Etching half-cycles are performed by exposing the oxidized Ru film to HCOOH vapor at 0.50Torr for 30s isothermally, which results in the removal of the oxidized Ru layer. The amount of Ru removed per ALE cycle is determined by comparing ex situ x-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements of the film before and after etching. When using 2min VUV/O-2 co-exposure, approximately 0.8 and 0.9 angstrom of Ru is etched per cycle at 100 and 150 degrees C, respectively. XRR and atomic force microscopy measurements indicate that the as-deposited and sputtered Ru film surface becomes smoother as ALE is performed. The etch rate decreases with ALE cycles and corresponds to a slowing oxidation rate, which is likely associated with the decrease in surface roughness. Density functional theory is used to study the adsorption of oxidants in a model Ru system, and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations describe O diffusion into the Ru substrate by following an O "probe" atom as it moves between Ru(002) atomic planes with 0.50 monolayer (ML) O on the surface. NEB results reveal an approximate energetic barrier to diffusion, E-a, of 5.10eV for O to move through the second and third atomic Ru layers when O, which can form an RuOx species, is subsurface. This E-a is in excess of the energetic gain of 4.23eV in adsorbing an O atom to Ru(002) with 0.50ML O. The difference in E-a and the adsorption energy likely contributes to the self-limiting nature of the oxidation and explains the observation that VUV/O-2 co-exposure time must be increased to allow additional time for O diffusing into the subsurface as it overcomes the barrier to subsurface O diffusion. The self-limiting oxidation of Ru arising from VUV/O-2 at low temperatures, in turn, enables an ALE process for Ru.},

  abstract = {We describe a bottom-up surface functionalization to design hybrid molecular coatings that tether biomembranes using wet chemistry. First, a monolayer was formed by immersion in a NH2-Ar-SO3H solution, allowing aryldiazonium salt radicals to spontaneously bind to it via strong C bonding. After formation of the air-stable and dense molecular monolayer (-Ar-SO3H), a subsequent activation was used to form highly reactive -Ar-SO2Cl groups nearly perpendicular to the monolayer. These can bind commercial surfactants, PEGylated oligomers and other inexpensive molecules via their -OH, -COOH, or -NH2 chain end-moieties, to build hybrid coatings. Metal and oxidized chromium, semi-conductor n-doped silicon (111), are the substrates tested for this protocol and the aromatic organic monolayers formed at their surface are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS reveals unambiguously the presence of C-Cr and C-Si bonds, ensuring robustness of the coatings. Functional sulfur groups (-SO3H) cover up to 6.5 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of the silicon interface and 4.7 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) of the oxidized chromium interface. These surface concentrations are comparable to the classic values obtained when the prefunctionalisation is driven by electrochemistry on conductors. Tethered lipid membranes formed on these coatings were analyzed by neutron reflectivity at the interface of functionalized n-doped silicon substrates after immersion in a solution of lipid vesicles and subsequent fusion. Results indicate a rather compact hybrid coating of Brij anchor-harpoon molecules that maintain a single lipid bilayer above the substrate, on top of a hydrated PEO cushion.},

  abstract = {The effect of water on the electroactive structuring of a tribologically relevant ionic liquid (IL) when dispersed in a polar solvent has been investigated at a gold electrode interface using neutron reflectivity (NR). For all solutions studied, the addition of small amounts of water led to clear changes in electroactive structuring of the IL at the electrode interface, which was largely determined by the bulk IL concentration. At a dilute IL concentration, the presence of water gave rise to a swollen interfacial structuring, which exhibited a greater degree of electroresponsivity with applied potential compared to an equivalent dry solution. Conversely, for a concentrated IL solution, the presence of water led to an overall thinning of the interfacial region and a crowding-like structuring, within which the composition of the inner layer IL layers varied systematically with applied potential. Complementary nanotribotronic atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements performed for the same IL concentration, in dry and ambient conditions, show that the presence of water reduces the lubricity of the IL boundary layers. However, consistent with the observed changes in the IL layers observed by NR, reversible and systematic control of the friction coefficient with applied potential was still achievable. Combined, these measurements provide valuable insight into the implications of water on the interfacial properties of ILs at electrified interfaces, which inevitably will determine their applicability in tribotronic and electrochemical contexts.},

In this work, ultrathin single-crystal SnO epitaxial films were achieved on r-sapphire by pulsed laser deposition. The quasi-2D SnO films have thicknesses ranging from 3.4 to 25.4 nm, allowing observation of quantum confinement effects in the optical bandgap. The critical thickness where the films relax in plane is around 19 nm. Below 19 nm, the films are strained compressively in plane and tensilely along the c-axis. Quantum confinement effects are observed by UV-IR spectroscopy for the optical transition at the direct bandgap. By fitting Brus equation, the reduced effective mass is deduced to be 0.137 +/- 0.016 me. The exciton radius and binding energy are 4.62 +/- 0.61 nm and 10.8 +/- 1.2 meV, respectively.

In this study, we performed thermal annealing to control the formation and distribution of FeO across the interface of a Fe-MgO system. The exchange bias phenomenon (i.e., a horizontal shift of magnetic hysteresis loops) was extended from involving only interface spins to involving the full-volume magnetization of the Fe film. The extended and reinforced exchange bias coupling in the annealed Fe/MgO(0 0 1) films can be attributed to the formation of a Fe-FeO matrix-like structure at the Fe/MgO interface under an increasing degree of interface roughness and the reduction or diffusion of oxygen from the interfacial oxides, as indicated by X-ray absorption near edge structures and X-ray reflectivity measurements. Moreover, the thermal stability of exchange bias coupling in the annealed Fe/MgO(0 0 1) films (maximum value at approximately 600 K) was considerably higher than that in conventional thin-film-based Fe/FeO structures (approximately 50 K).},

The multilayers after annealing or Ni addition show a small increase in coercivity without considerable changes in their anisotropy.

Here, we perform a spatial characterization of the magnetic phases and the local magnetic environment around the Fe atoms, as well as the variation of the open-volumes around atomic sites. Thus, a direct correspondence between the existence of the three magnetic phases and lattice defects is revealed. By careful selection of the irradiating fluence, we show that it is possible to produce simple and thermally stable magnetic configurations, such as uniform magnetization or a bilayer phase structure. Furthermore, the thin film surface and interfaces are observed as the nucleation sites for the transitions between the phases. These results demonstrate a sensitive nanoscale manipulation of magnetic properties, shedding light on magnetic ordering in alloy lattices and broadening the scope for applications.},

  abstract = {Manipulating topotactic phase transformations via orderly ion transfer in complex oxides ABO(x) is ubiquitous in advanced applications such as ionotronics, ion-batteries and catalysts. Most of such ion-mediated transformations are accomplished by the transfer of oxygen or A-site ions. However, implementing the transformation via the transfer of B-site ions, despite the great challenge to overcome a large cohesive energy, has unique advantage since they host most functional properties of materials. Here, we present a tri-state phase transformation from perovskite (P) to brownmillerite (BM) and to single-layered perovskite (SL) structure via the concerted migration of oxygen and B-site Co-ions in La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 thin films. Ac-STEM, XPS, XAS, PNR, magnetic and electric measurements demonstrated that presented B-site Co-cation transfer is along the CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer of the BM film, which leads to the reconfiguration of 3d-electrons and spin state in remanent Co ions and causes tremendous changes in magnetic and electric properties: from canted-antiferromagnetic insulator in BM phase to ferromagnetic insulator in SL phase. First-principles calculations revealed that the La3+-doping at A-site largely reduces the cohesive energy of Co-ions in CoO4 and destabilize the CoO4 tetrahedron of BM phase, which explains the formation of Co-ions transfer channel in the CoO4 tetrahedral sub-layer. The present study highlights the effectiveness of regulating topotactic transformation via B-site ions transfer and provides a new pathway for manipulating the topotactic transformation with diverse functionalities.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is the synthesis of oxides containing metals with high electronegativity (metals that are hard to oxidize). The use of reactive organometallic precursors can potentially address this issue. To investigate the formation of radicals in MBE, we explored three carefully chosen metal-organic precursors of tin for SnO2 and BaSnO3 growth: tetramethyltin (TMT), tetraethyltin (TET), and hexamethylditin (HMDT). All three precursors produced single-crystalline, atomically smooth, and epitaxial SnO2 (101) films on r-Al2O3 ( 10 1 <overbar></mml:mover> 2 <mml:mo stretchy="false">) in the presence of oxygen plasma. The study of growth kinetics revealed reaction-limited and flux-limited regimes except for TET, which also exhibited a decrease in the deposition rate with increasing temperature above similar to 800 degrees C. Contrary to these similarities, the performance of these precursors was dramatically different for BaSnO3 growth. TMT and TET were ineffective in supplying adequate tin, whereas HMDT yielded phase-pure, stoichiometric BaSnO3 films. Significantly, HMDT resulted in phase-pure and stoichiometric BaSnO3 films even without the use of an oxygen plasma (i.e., with molecular oxygen alone). These results are discussed using the ability of HMDT to form tin radicals and therefore assisting with Sn -> Sn4+ oxidation reaction. Structural and electronic transport properties of films grown using HMDT with and without oxygen plasma are compared. This study provides guideline for the choice of precursors that will enable the synthesis of metal oxides containing hard-to-oxidize metals using reactive radicals in MBE.},

  abstract = {Thin film fabrication of 2D layered organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-OIHPs) for spintronic applications has been attempted using solution-based process like Langmuir-Blodgett technique. However, monolayer or few-layered 2D magnets are not yet realized, even though a wide spectrum of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) OIHPs are known as quasi-2D Heisenberg magnets in bulk compounds. Here, chemical exfoliation by solvent engineering is applied to successfully synthesize large-sized, few unit-cell-thick 2D RP-OIHPs. Comprehensive structural characterization reveals that binary co-solvents with high relative polarity in spin coating technique are the most effective among nine kinds of solvents. Above all, this enables few-layered 2D RP-OIHP ultrathin films sustaining their intrinsic magnetic order. It is found that XY-like magnetic anisotropy driven by Jahn-Teller effect responsible for ferromagnetism in seven-layered (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)CuCl4 ultrathin films remains very robust, whereas Ising-like dipolar anisotropy responsible for canted antiferromagnetism in ten-layered (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)(2)MnCl4 ultrathin films is greatly reduced. It is expected that ferromagnetism even at monolayer limit should be possible by means of further sophisticated solvent engineering as long as Jahn-Teller effect is active. The chemical exfoliation using solvent engineering unambiguously can bring about a new breakthrough in the development of 2D RP-OIHP van der Waals magnets for ultrahigh energy-efficient spintronic, opto-spintronic devices.},

XRR was recorded from the PPy film in an aqueous 0.1 M perchloric acid at electric potentials between -0.2 V and +0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The PPy film shows typical reversible and linear changes in film thickness and electron density arising from the potential-dependent electrolyte incorporation. By introducing EC-XRR, a comprehensive analysis combining in situ XRR and EC, the net number of electrons passing through the PPy-electrolyte interface was deduced along with the potential-induced thickness variations, indicating a complex exchange mechanism. Evidently, along with the anion transfer, parallel charge compensation by protons and a volume and electron compensating counterflow of solvent molecules take place. Complementary time-dependent EC-XRR scans indicate that these exchange mechanisms are individual in two potential ranges. The low actuation along with a high pseudocapacitance suggest the fast potentiodynamically deposited PPy film as a promising supercapacitor material.},

  abstract = {The multilayer nanostructures have drawn attention in fields from spintronics to microwave electronics. The purpose of this work was to determine the composition of individual layers and to control interfaces in three-layer superstructures [(Co40Fe40B20)(34)(SiO2)(66)/ZnO/C](46) by means of X-ray diffraction and X-ray reflectivity. The samples with different thicknesses of metal-containing composite layers together with zinc oxide and carbon interlayers were deposited on the glass substrate by ion-beam sputtering of three targets, one of which was a composite (Co40Fe40B20)(34)(SiO2)(66). X-ray diffraction results showed the X-ray amorphous state of the ferromagnetic metal clusters CoFeB, the dielectric matrix of silicon oxide SiO2, and carbon interlayers. However, the intermediate layers of the zinc oxide ZnO were found to have a nanocrystalline structure. The X-ray reflectivity measurements indicate a good agreement between the experimental and nominal values of both the periods of three-layer superstructures and the thicknesses of metal-containing composite layers and interlayers.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is used to better understand the oxidation of Pd metal using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light co-exposed with O-2, which is known to produce O and O-3. The oxidation of Pd metal arising from O, O-2, and O-3 is assessed on bare Pd, Pd with a 0.25 monolayer of adsorbed atomic O, and Pd with increasing O incorporation into the substrate. DFT calculations are complemented experimentally by co-exposing 20 nm Pd films to 1 Torr of O-2 and VUV photons (6.5 < h nu < 11.3 eV) from a D-2 lamp at temperatures ranging from 50 to 200 degrees C and times from 30 s to 40 min. Oxidation of Pd is characterized using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Co-exposures at 50 degrees C and 1 Torr O-2 are performed with the Pd illuminated by the VUV light and shadowed from the VUV light in attempting to select for the oxidant that impinges on the Pd surface and causes oxidation. Results suggest that atomic O incident from the gas phase is responsible for oxidation of Pd, as no PdOx formation is observed for the same time period with the sample shadowed. Growth of PdOx via O diffusion is studied with the nudged elastic band method. Atomic O diffusion through Pd has an activation energy barrier of similar to 2.87 eV with respect to a surface O. This decreases to similar to 1.80 eV once the 0.25 monolayer of O occupies the surface. The extent of Pd oxidation is limited to the near-surface Pd region for all times and temperatures investigated. PdOx formation does not appear to exceed one to two atomic layers of Pd for conditions explored herein.},

  abstract = {In the field of functional nanomaterials, core-satellite nanoclusters have recently elicited great interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, core-satellite synthetic routes to date are hampered by delicate and multistep reaction conditions and no practical method has been reported for the ordering of these structures onto a surface monolayer. Herein we show a reproducible and simplified thin film process to fabricate bimetallic raspberry nanoclusters using block copolymer (BCP) lithography. The fabricated inorganic raspberry nanoclusters consisted of a similar to 36 nm alumina core decorated with similar to 15 nm Au satellites after infusing multilayer BCP nanopatterns. A series of cylindrical BCPs with different molecular weights allowed us to dial in specific nanodot periodicities (from 30 to 80 nm). Highly ordered BCP nanopatterns were then selectively infiltrated with alumina and Au species to develop multi-level bimetallic raspberry features. Microscopy and X-ray reflectivity analysis were used at each fabrication step to gain further mechanistic insights and understand the infiltration process. Furthermore, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering studies of infiltrated films confirmed the excellent order and vertical orientation over wafer scale areas of Al2O3/Au raspberry nanoclusters. We believe our work demonstrates a robust strategy towards designing hybrid nanoclusters since BCP blocks can be infiltrated with various low cost salt-based precursors. The highly controlled nanocluster strategy disclosed here could have wide ranging uses, in particular for metasurface and optical based sensor applications.},

  abstract = {Water-gated organic field-effect transistors (WGOFETs) are relevant devices for use in the fields of biosensors and biosystems. However, real applications require very stringent performance in terms of electrochemical stability and charge mobility to the organic semiconductor in contact with an aqueous environment. Here, a comparative study of two small-molecule electron-transporting perylenediimide semiconductors, which differ only in the N-substituents named PDIF-CN2 and PDI8-CN2 is reported. The two materials present similar solid-state arrangements but, while the PDI8-CN2 shows a more 3D growth modality and electron mobility independent of the semiconductor layer thickness (approximate to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)), the PDIF-CN2 has an almost-2D growth modality and the mobility increases with the semiconductor film thickness, reaching a maximum value of approximate to 5 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 30 nm. Above this thickness, the PDIF-CN2 switches to a more 3D growth modality, and the mobility drops by one order of magnitude. XRR analysis indicates that a PDIF-CN2 film can be modeled as a dense layered structure in which each layer is decoupled from the others due to the presence of fluorocarbon-chains. The availability of additional pathways for charge transport from buried layers and the 2D versus 3D growth can explain the mobility dependence on the film thickness.},

Such high cathodic potentials should lead to reduction to metallic Ir (Pourbaix diagram). From the IrO2 lattice parameters, determined during cathodic polarization in a H2SO4 electrolyte solution (pH 0.4), it is estimated that the unit cell volume increases by 1% due likely to proton incorporation, which is supported by the lack of significant swelling of the IrO2(110) film derived from X-ray reflectivity experiments. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that protons are incorporated into the IrO2(110) lattice below -1.0 V, although Ir remains exclusively in the IV+ oxidation state down to -1.20 V. Obviously, further hydrogenation of the lattice oxygen of IrO2(110) toward water is suppressed for kinetic reasons and hints at a rate-determining chemical step that cannot be controlled by the electrode potential.},

The investigation is important for development of Cr/Ti soft X-ray multilayer mirrors for "water window" applications in the wavelength regime of 2.2-4.4 nm. Initially few multilayers have been deposited and the highest reflectivity at first Bragg peak positions of the GIXR plots have been obtained for the Cr layer to bi-layer thickness ratio of 0.4. Subsequently, keeping the ratio fixed a set of five samples with bi-layer thickness varying from 3.8 nm to 2.1 nm have been prepared. For the all five ML samples reported in this communication, Ti layer thickness is greater than 1.3 nm, however, the Cr layer thickness varies from 1.5 to 0.8 nm in the above range of bi-layer thickness and it undergoes continuous-to discontinuous transition. Cr films undergo significant change in morphology as the thickness changes and thus the interfaces are also evolved differently. Analysis of the diffused X-ray scattering data shows that interface imperfection of Ti-on-Cr interfaces is dominated by interface diffusion at low Cr thickness (discontinuous) regime and by interface roughness at high Cr thickness (continuous) regime, while in case of Cr-on-Ti interfaces, interface roughness dominates throughout the whole thickness regime. For the sample with highest bi-layer thickness of 3.8 nm high Bragg peak reflectivity value close to the ideal case is obtained manifesting high thickness uniformity, very low interface imperfection and high vertical correlation length across the interfaces for this sample which is also confirmed by cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy. A 50 bi-layer sample prepared with the above bi-layer thickness shows high reflectivity of 5.6% at 2.84 nm water window soft X-ray wavelength.},

Varying the Tb:Co ratio in these alloys allows for tuning properties such as the saturation magnetic moment, coercive field, and the performance of light-induced magnetization switching. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic, optical, and magneto-optical properties of various TbxCo100-x thin-film alloy compositions. We report on the effect the choice of different seeding layers has on the structural and magnetic properties of TbxCo100-x layers. We also demonstrate that for a range of alloys, deposited on fused silica substrates, with Tb content of 24-30 at. %, helicity-dependent all-optical switching of magnetization can be achieved, albeit in a multishot framework. We explain this property to arise from the helicity-dependent laser-induced magnetization on the Co sublattice due to the inverse Faraday effect. Our paper provides an insight into material aspects for future potential hybrid magnetoplasmonic TbCo-based architectures.},

It turns out that the planarity of the single-crystalline IrO2(110) film is lost in that IrO2(110) oxide domains delaminate at a cathodic potential of -0.18 V. Obviously, the electrolyte solution is able to reach the RuO2(110) layer presumably through the surface grain boundaries of the IrO2(110) layer. Subsequently, the single-crystalline RuO2(110) structure-directing template is reduced to amorphous hydrous RuO2, with the consequence that the IrO2(110) film loses partly its adhesion to the template. From in situ XRR experiments we find that the IrO2(110) film does not swell upon cathodic polarization down to -0.18 V, while from in situ SXRD experiments, the lattice constants of IrO2(110) are shown to be not affected. The rooflike mesostructure of the IrO2(110) flakes remains intact after cathodic polarization to -0.18 V, evidencing that the crystallinity of IrO2(110) is retained.},

A larger net Co valence in films grown at substrate temperatures below 350 degrees C results in a smaller lattice parameter, a smaller optical band gap, and stronger magnetic exchange bias. Observation of this phenomena suggests a complex interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics during ESO synthesis; specifically thermal history, oxygen chemical potential, and entropy. In addition to the compositional degrees of freedom available to ESO systems, subtle nuances in atomic structure at constant metallic element proportions can strongly influence properties, simultaneously complicating physical characterization and providing opportunities for property tuning and development.},

  abstract = {The transition-metal dichalcogenide HfS(2)is a promising alternative semiconductor with adequate band gap and high carrier mobility. However, a controllable growth of continuous HfS(2)films with selectivity for specific surfaces at a low temperature on a large scale has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, HfS(2)films are grown at 100 degrees C by atomic layer deposition (ALD) based on the precursors tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium and H2S. In situ vibrational spectroscopy allows for the definition of the temperature range over which (Me2N)(4)Hf chemisorbs as one monolayer. In that range, sequential exposures of the solid surface with (Me2N)(4)Hf and H2S result in self-limiting reactions that yield alternating surface termination with dimethylamide and thiol. Repeating the cycle grows smooth, continuous, stoichiometric films of thicknesses adjustable from angstroms to >100 nm, as demonstrated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, XRR, AFM, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and TEM. The well-defined surface chemistry enables one to deposit HfS(2)selectively using, for example, patterns generated in molecular self-assembled monolayers. This novel ALD reaction combines several attractive features necessary for integrating HfS(2)into devices.},

  abstract = {The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is suppressed by a large number of defects in the interface of heterostructure due to lattice mismatch. In this paper, the (001) oriented rutile MnO2 thin films with different thicknesses were grown on rutile TiO2 substrates. The lattice mismatch between film and substrate was minimized through a Ti diffusion self-adapting layer. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy mappings were used to measure the diffusion range of Ti. The results of high-resolution X-ray diffraction confirmed that the dependence of the out-of-plane lattice parameter on the thickness was consistent with the self-adapting interface model, indicating that Ti diffusion can indeed alleviate the lattice mismatch. In addition, the results of the synchrotron soft X-ray absorption spectrum indicated that the capacitance of the thin films with a large proportion of Ti diffusion increased with electrons involved in the reaction. Although the decrease of carrier density and conductivity of the thinner films depressed the electrochemical activity, it is worth mentioning that the film we designed still has considerable specific capacitance even when it is very thin, which can provide a new idea for the development of thinner and larger capacity potential micro-supercapacitors.},

  abstract = {Electrification of vehicles and renewable energy is increasing the demand for permanent magnets, but the cost and scarcity of rare-earth metals is an obstacle. Creating nanocomposites of rigidly exchange-coupled hard and soft magnets, for which the magnetization reversal occurs as in a single magnetic-phase material, is a promising route toward rare-earth-lean permanent magnets with high energy products. The hard/soft exchange coupling is, however, often reduced due to rough interfaces and structural defects, resulting in exchange-spring behavior rather than rigid exchange coupling. Here, it is shown that artificially sandwiched hard and soft amorphous magnets produced by magnetron sputtering exhibit smooth interfaces, and the first order reversal curve (FORC) technique is used to show that the hard and the soft phases are rigidly exchange coupled. Micromagnetic simulations, using a random-anisotropy model, are used to predict the thickness limit of the rigid exchange coupling. A great advantage of amorphous hard/soft composites is the possibility to obtain a wide range of magnetic properties by finely tuning the composition of the individual phases.},

Previous studies have shown that LSCO can separate into magnetic sublayers, which possess distinct trends as the total LSCO thickness increases. In this study, we used polarized neutron reflectometry to quantify changes in the magnetic and chemical depth profiles, and it confirms the formation of similar to 12 angstrom-thick interfacial LSCO and LSMO layers, characterized by a decreased nuclear scattering length density compared to the bulk of the layers. This decrease is attributed to the combined effects of oxygen vacancy formation and interfacial charge transfer, which lead to magnetically active Co2+ ions with ionic radii larger than the Co3+/Co4+ ions typically found in bulk LSCO or single-layer films. The interfacial magnetization values, as well as Co2+ ion and oxygen vacancy concentrations, depend strongly on the LSCO layer thickness. These results highlight the sensitive interplay of the cation valence states, oxygen vacancy concentration, and magnetization at interfaces in perovskite oxide multilayers, demonstrating the potential to tune their functional properties via careful design of their structure.},

Because of its beneficial properties, it fulfills multiple functionalities as information-storing, spin-filtering, and reference layer in magnetic tunnel junctions. In future, this versatility can be exploited beyond the traditional applications of spintronics by combining with advanced materials, such as oxide-based materials. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is their predominant growth-method, and thus the compatibility of CoFeB with this growth technique will be tested here. This encompasses a comprehensive investigation of the structural and magnetic propoperties. In particular, we find a substantial 'dead' magnetic layer and confirm that it is caused by oxidation employing the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) effect. The low damping encountered in vector network analyzer-based ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) renders them suitable for magnonics applications. These findings demonstrate that CoFeB thin films are compatible with emergent, PLD-grown materials, ensuring their relevance for future applications.},

Although the Kr-sputtering process can work at a lower pressure, the interface width-especially the interface roughness-is a little larger than that made by Ar. A stronger polycrystallization and a lower content of sputter gas atoms were found in the Kr-made sample, which can be explained by the joint effect from less recoiled particles and lower sputtering pressure. A good reflectance of 68% of the Kr made multilayer was measured at 10 keV, which is only slightly lower than that of the Ar made sample (71%).},

  abstract = {Artificial ferromagnetic (FM)/nonmagnetic multilayers, with large enough FM thickness to prevent the dominance of interface anisotropies, offer a straightforward insight into the understanding and control of perpendicular standing spin wave (PSSW) modes. Here we present a study of the static and dynamic magnetic properties of [Co(3.0 nm)/Au(0.6nm)](1 <= N <= 30) multilayers. Magnetometry reveals that the samples exhibit magnetization reversal properties typical of an effective single layer with weak perpendicular anisotropy, with the distinctive thickness-dependent magnetization reorientation transition from uniform in-plane to out-of-plane stripe domains at remanence. However, when such multilayer systems are out-of-plane saturated, the dynamic response reveals the existence of several different ferromagnetic resonances in the form of PSSW modes that strongly depend on the material modulation characteristics along the total thickness. These modes are induced by the layer stacking itself as the effective single layer model fails to describe the observed complex dynamics. In contrast to most systems considered in the past, described by a dynamic model of a single effectively homogeneous thick layer, the specific structures investigated here provide a unique platform for a large degree of tunability of the mode frequencies and amplitude profiles. We argue that the combination of periodic magnetic properties with vertical deformation gradients, arising from heteroepitaxial strain relaxation, converts the Au interlayer regions into a vertical regular array of magnetic pinning planes for the PSSW modes, which promotes the complex dynamics observed in this system.},

  abstract = {Neutron reflectivity (NR) measurements have been employed to study the interfacial structuring and composition of electroresponsive boundary layers formed by an ionic liquid (IL) lubricant at an electrified gold interface when dispersed in a polar solvent. The results reveal that both the composition and extent of the IL boundary layers intricately depend on the bulk IL concentration and the applied surface potential. At the lowest concentration (5% w/w), a preferential adsorption of the IL cation at the gold electrode is observed, which hinders the ability to electro-induce changes in the boundary layers. In contrast, at higher IL bulk concentrations (10 and 20% w/w), the NR results reveal a significantly larger concentration of the IL ions at the gold interface that exhibit significantly greater electroresponsivity, with clear changes in the layer composition and layer thickness observed for different potentials. In complementary atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements on an electrified gold surface, such IL boundary layers are demonstrated to provide excellent friction reduction and electroactive friction (known as tribotronics). In agreement with the NR results obtained, clear concentration effects are also observed. Together such results provide valuable molecular insight into the electroactive structuring of ILs in solvent mixtures, as well as provide mechanistic understanding of their tribotronic behaviours.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of crystallographically well-defined thin films of topological materials is important for unraveling their mesoscale quantum properties and for device applications. Mn3Ge, an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal with a chiral magnetic structure on a kagome lattice, is expected to have enhanced Berry curvature around Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy, leading to large anomalous Hall/Nernst effects and a large spin-Hall effect. Using magnetron sputtering, we have grown epitaxial thin films of hexagonal D0(19) Mn3Ge that are flat and continuous. Large anomalous Nernst and inverse spin-Hall effects are observed in thermoelectric and spin-pumping devices. The anomalous Nernst signal in our Mn3Ge films is estimated to be 0.1 mu,V/K and is comparable to that in ferromagnetic Fe, despite Mn3Ge having a weak magnetization of similar to 3.5 m mu(B)/Mn at room temperature. The spin-mixing conductance is 90.5 nm(-2) at the Py/Mn3Ge interface, and the spin-Hall angle in Mn3Ge is estimated to be about eight times of that in Pt.},

  abstract = {Perpendicularly magnetized layers are essential for information storage to increase the storage density. Modulating perpendicular magnetization by an electric field offers a promising solution to lower energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate a remarkable electric field modulation of perpendicular magnetization in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/Ta ultrathin films on a ferroelectric substrate. By measuring the anomalous Hall effect under in situ electric fields, we observe a giant magnetoelectric effect with the large converse magnetoelectric coefficient of -2.1 x 10(-6) s m(-1) at H-perpendicular to = -20 Oe and -0.9 x 10(-6) s m(-1) at H-perpendicular to = 0 Oe, which is comparable to that in multiferroic heterostructures with in-plane magnetization. Additionally, Kerr imaging shows that electric fields observably affect magnetic domain structures of the Pt/Co/Ta ultrathin films indicating a giant magnetoelectric effect. We further measure in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray reflectivity with electric fields, which suggests that this giant magnetoelectric effect is attributed to strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling and is closely related to electric-field-varied interface roughness. Our findings highlight the role of interface roughness in exploring electrical control of perpendicular magnetization.},

Element-resolved x-ray magnetic measurements were used to investigate PIM in Pt layered with two different rare-earth (RE):3d transition-metal (TM) ferrimagnetic alloys in which the net moment was dominated by either the RE or the TM at room temperature. We observed significant PIM in Pt confined to a 2-nm interfacial region for Pt/Co77Gd23 and Pt/(Fe50Co50)(77)Gd-23 and, in both cases, the PIM was parallel to the TM sublattice rather than the RE or the net moment.

However, its impact length scale is constrained at 2-6 unit cells close to the interface and the octahedral rotations relax quickly into bulk tilt angles away from interface. Here, a long-range (up to 12 unit cells) suppression of MnO(6)octahedral rotations in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)through the formation of superlattices with SrTiO(3)can be achieved. The suppressed MnO(6)octahedral rotations strongly modify the magnetic and electronic properties of La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)and hence create a new ferromagnetic insulating state with enhanced Curie temperature of 235 K. The emergent properties in La(0.9)Ba(0.1)MnO(3)arise from a preferential occupation of the out-of-plane Mnd(3)(z)(-)(r)(2)(2)orbital and a reduced Mn e(g)bandwidth, induced by the suppressed octahedral rotations. The realization of long-range tuning of BO(6)octahedra via superlattices can be applicable to other strongly correlated perovskites for exploring new emergent quantum phenomena.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are attracting interest as efficient information-storage devices with low energy consumption, and have been experimentally and theoretically investigated in multilayers including ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets. The 3D spin texture of skyrmions demonstrated in ferromagnetic multilayers provides a powerful pathway for understanding the stabilization of ferromagnetic skyrmions. However, the manipulation mechanism of skyrmions in antiferromagnets is still lacking. A Hall balance with a ferromagnet/insulating spacer/ferromagnet structure is considered to be a promising candidate to study skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets. Here, high-density Neel-type skyrmions are experimentally observed at zero field and room temperature by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in a Hall balance (core structure [Co/Pt](n)/NiO/[Co/Pt](n)) with interfacial canted magnetizations because of interlayer ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between top and bottom [Co/Pt](n)multilayers, where the Co layers in [Co/Pt](n)are always ferromagnetically coupled. Micromagnetic simulations show that the generation and density of skyrmions are strongly dependent on interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) and easy-axis orientation. Direct experimental evidence of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets is provided, suggesting that the proposed approach offers a promising alternative mechanism for room-temperature spintronics.},

It exerts tight control over entry and exit of substances, is responsible for signaling with other cells in multicellular organisms and prevents pathogens from entering the cell. In the case of bacteria and viruses, the cellular membrane also hosts the proteins enabling invasion of the host organism. In a very real sense therefore, the cellular membrane is central to all life. The study of the cell membrane and membrane proteins in particular has therefore attracted significant attention. Due to the enormous variety of tasks performed by the membrane, it is a highly complex and challenging structure to study. Ideally, membrane components would be studied in isolation from this environment, but unlike water soluble proteins, the amphiphilic environment provided by the cellular membrane is key to the structure and function of the cell membrane. Therefore, model membranes have been developed to provide an environment in which a membrane protein can be studied. This review presents a set of tools that enable the comprehensive characterization of membrane proteins: electrochemical tools, surface plasmon resonance, neutron scattering, the surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy are discussed, with a particular focus on experimental technique and data evaluation.},

This and the limited number of processing parameters often prevent the synthesis of metastable compounds. Precisely controlling the number of atoms and nanoarchitecture of layered elemental precursors enabled the selective synthesis of two closely related metastable tin vanadium selenides via near-diffusionless reactions at low temperatures. Although the nanoarchitectures of the precursors required to form [(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) and [(SnSe)(1.15)](1) (VSe2)(1) are very similar, controlling the local composition of the SnISe layers in the precursors enables the selective synthesis of either compound. The metastable alloy SnxV1-xSe2 was preferentially formed over [(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1), which has the identical composition, by modifying the nanoarchitecture of the precursor. Ex situ in-plane X-ray diffraction and X-ray reflectivity collected as a function of annealing temperature provided information on lateral and perpendicular growth of [(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1). The presence of Laue oscillations throughout the self-assembly provided atomic-scale information on the thickness of the [(SnSe2)(0.80)](1)(VSe2)(1) domains, giving insights into the self-assembly process. A reaction mechanism is proposed and used to rationalize how composition and nanoarchitecture control the reaction pathway through the free energy landscape.},

  abstract = {To optimize the catalytic functionality of cerium oxide it is important to understand the structural modifications associated with reduction and the role of the proximity of metals, which are often coupled with the oxide in the applications. For this purpose, the evolution of the short- and long-range structure of cerium oxide ultrathin epitaxial films and nanostructures supported on Pt(111) is investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ce L(3)edge and surface X-ray diffraction, during reduction by thermal treatments in vacuum. In epitaxial nanoislands reduction is associated with a contraction of the Ce-O distance and with the appearance of Ce-Pt bonds. The formation of a phase with a (2 x 2) periodicity after a thermal treatment at 1023 K is ascribed to the formation of a Pt5Ce alloy. Films of 3 nm thickness do not show, on average, significant structural modifications with the same thermal treatment, consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction involves only the topmost surface layers and it does not influence significantly the bulk structure of the material. This study demonstrates a strong interaction between cerium oxide and platinum, which has implications for the reactivity and stability of catalysts based on metals combined with reducible oxides.},

A vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light source (115 < lambda < 400 nm) is used in conjunction with a controlled O-2 gas exposure to produce PdOx at 100 degrees C. The amount of PdOx that forms is dependent on the duration of coexposure of O-2 at 1 Torr and VUV irradiation. A minimum coexposure time of 1 min is required to partially oxidize 2 nm Pd while 3 min is required for 20 nm Pd films, which is verified in situ using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Formic acid vapor is used to complete the etch cycle, which does not etch Pd-0 and only removes the PdOx that forms. Repeated etch cycles on a similar to 20 nm Pd thin film yield an etch rate of 2.81 angstrom/cycle, which is characterized in situ using XPS and ex situ using X-ray reflectivity. The morphology of the Pd-0 surface does not change appreciably with etching. The only observed effect of repeated ALE cycles is a reduction in the roughness of the Pd film, which is measured using atomic force microscopy.},

We show how both the B-site cation and anion composition influence the structural, electronic, and optical properties of this family of perovskite materials. The Fe substitution of Mn in SrMnO2.5 is gradually expands the c-axis parameter, as indicated by X-ray diffraction. With increasing x, the F content incorporated under identical fluorination conditions increases, reaching its maximum in SrFeO2.5-delta F gamma. In the compounds with mixed B-site occupation, the Fe 2p photoemission peaks are shifted upon fluorination, while the Mn 2p peaks are not, suggesting inductive effects lead to asymmetric responses in how F alters the Mn and Fe bonds. Electronic transport measurements reveal all compounds are insulators, with the exception of SrFeO3, and demonstrate that fluorination increases resistivity for all values of x. Optical absorption spectra in the SrFexMn1-xO2.5 and SrFexMn1-xO3 films evolve systematically as a function of x, consistent with a physical scenario in which optical changes with Fe substitution arise from a linear combination of Mn and Fe 3d bands within the electronic structure. In contrast, the F incorporation induces nonlinear changes to the optical response, suggesting a more complex impact on the electronic structure in materials with concurrent B-site and anion site substitution.},

Here, it is shown that the correlated metal SrxNbO3 with x < 1 is ideally suited as a UV-transparent electrode material, enabling UV light-emitting diodes for a wide range of applications from water disinfection to polymer curing. It is demonstrated that SrxNbO3 thin films can be grown by radio frequency (RF) sputtering and that they remain in the perovskite phase despite a sizeable Sr deficiency. The electrical and optical properties are characterized and compared to those of commonly used indium tin oxide (ITO) and Sn-doped Ga2O3 transparent conductor standards. SrxNbO3 films were found to have sheet resistances as low as 30 Omega sq(-1) with optical transmission at a wavelength of 280 nm up to 86%, marking a two-order-of-magnitude increase over the performance of traditional UV-transparent conductors. The compatibility of SrxNbO3 with a physical vapor deposition technique that is widely employed in the transparent conductor coating industry along with the robustness of the highly electrically conducting and optically transparent perovskite phase makes it an ideal transparent electrode for applications in the UV spectrum.},

  abstract = {The ability to tune the competition between the in-plane and out-of-plane orientation of magnetization provides a means to construct thermal sensors with a sharp spin reorientation transition at specific temperatures. We have observed such a tuneable, temperature-driven spin reorientation in structurally amorphous, ferrimagnetic rare-earth transition-metal alloy thin films using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and magnetic measurements. The nature of the spin reorientation transition in FeGd can be fully explained by a nonequilibrium, nanoscale modulation of the chemical composition of the films. This modulation leads to a magnetic domain pattern of nanoscale speckles superimposed on a background of in-plane domains that form Landau configurations in mu m-scale patterned elements. It is this speckle magnetic structure that gives rise to a sharp two-step reversal mechanism that is temperature dependent. The possibility to balance competing anisotropies through the temperature opens opportunities to create and manipulate topological spin textures.},

Film growth was studied using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Self-limiting growth was observed between 100 and 175 degrees C, but the thermal decomposition of the Hf precursor occurred at higher temperatures. The film properties were investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray reflectivity, x-ray diffraction, ellipsometry, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The as-deposited films were found to consist of an amorphous mixture of HfO2 and B2O3, and had a lower density and lower refractive index compared to pure HfO2 thin films. Annealing the films to >750 degrees C yielded crystalline monoclinic HfO2 with a density of 9g/cm(3) and a refractive index of 2.10.},

  abstract = {Functional thin films are commonly integrated in electronic devices as part of a multi-layer architecture. Metal/oxide/metal structurese.g.in resistive switching memory and piezoelectric microelectrochemical devices are relevant applications. The films are mostly fabricated from the vapour phase or by solution deposition. Processing conditions with a limited thermal budget typically yield nanocrystalline or amorphous layers. For these aperiodic materials, the structure is described in terms of the local atomic order on the length scale of a few chemical bonds up to several nanometres. Previous structural studies of the short-range order in thin films have addressed the simple case of single coatings on amorphous substrates. By contrast, this work demonstrates how to probe the local structure of two stacked functional layers by means of grazing incidence total X-ray scattering and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The key to separating the contributions of the individual thin films is the variation of the incidence angle below the critical angle of total external reflection, In this way, structural information was obtained for functional oxides on textured electrodes,i.e.PbZr(0.53)O(0.47)O(3)on Pt[111] and HfO(2)on TiN, as well as HfO2-TiO(x)bilayers. For these systems, the transformations from disordered phases into periodic structuresviathermal teatment are described. These examples highlight the opportunity to develop a detailed understanding of structural evolution during the fabrication of real thin film devices using the PDF technique.},

Thin homoepitaxial films of magnetite, grown using isotopically labeled Fe-57, were investigated by neutron reflectivity and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. By heating the thin films in high vacuum to different temperatures for a well-defined time and determining the Fe-57 distribution along the surface normal, the diffusion lengths are obtained. For the investigated temperature range, diffusion constants of the order of 10(-20) m(2)/s are deduced. These results are important in view of near-surface mass transport induced by oxygen chemical potential differences occurring when magnetite is exposed to different gas atmospheres or by adsorbates.},

  abstract = {The Pb(II)-binding mechanism on an annealed hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface was studied using crystal truncation rod (CTR) X-ray diffraction coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The best fit CTR model suggested that Pb(II) sorbed selectively to one type of edge-sharing surface site (ES2) over two other potential surface sites. From the best fit model structure, it was found that the Pb surface complex species forms a trigonal pyramid geometry. The base consists of three oxygen groups, two of which are associated with the substrate surface (O-I and O-III) and one that is a distal O extending toward solution. The trigonal pyramid geometry is slightly distorted with Pb-O bond lengths ranging from 2.21 to 2.31 angstrom and O-Pb-O bond angles ranging from 72 degrees to 75 degrees. Under this structural distortion, the nearest distance between Pb and Fe is found to be 3.39(1) angstrom. Consistent with the CTR results, DFT calculations indicate the Pb binding energy at the ES2 site is at least 0.16 eV more favorable than that at the other two potential binding sites considered. Using bond-valence rules we propose a stoichiometry of Pb(II) binding on the hematite (1 (1) over bar 02) surface which indicates proton release through the deprotonation of all oxygen groups bonding to Pb.},

Processing solvent additives are well known for regulating the BHJ active layer morphology; however, there are few reports regarding the quantitative evaluation of the effect. Herein, a study of the quantitative determination of the vertical segregation in combination of molecular ordering of PBDB-T/ITIC blend films with various 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) contents is provided. A 0.5% (volume ratio) DIO-added blend film achieves the highest power conversion efficiency of 10.75%. The reduced performance of the PSCs resulted from the excessive vertical component segregation and overcrystallization investigated by various techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that DIO aggravates the PBDB-T enrichment region at the air side. Neutron reflectivity further quantitatively figures out the phase separation effect. Although increased crystallinity of ITIC and a higher face-on ratio of PBDB-T in active layer were obtained with increased DIO content approved by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), the enhanced vertical distribution along with the enhanced crystal size of ITIC leads to the reduced performance of the PSCs due to the reduced carrier transportation paths between donor and acceptor.},

This work combines operando characterization and computational techniques to examine the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on RuO2 surfaces. Understanding the nature of active sites is central to controlling (electro)catalytic activity. Here we employed surface X-ray scattering coupled with density functional theory and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to examine the oxygen evolution reaction on RuO2 surfaces as a function of voltage. At 1.5 V-RHE, our results suggest that there is an -OO group on the coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium (Ru-CUS) site of the (100) surface (and similarly for (110)), but adsorbed oxygen on the Ru-CUS site of (101). Density functional theory results indicate that the removal of -OO from the Ru-CUS site, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to a neighbouring -OH (-OO-H), could be the rate-determining step for (100) (similarly for (110)), where its reduced binding on (100) increased activity. A further reduction in binding energy on the Ru-CUS site of (101) resulted in a different rate-determining step (-O + H2O - (H+ + e(-)) -> -OO-H) and decreased activity. Our study provides molecular details on the active sites, and the influence of their local coordination environment on activity.},

In the case of the latter, there is an increasing demand for the study of non-halogenated ILs, as many fluorinated anions have been found to produce corrosive and toxic halides under tribological conditions. Here, the interfacial structuring of a series of four imidazolium ILs ([C(n)C(1)Im]) of varying alkyl chain lengths (n = 5, 6, 7, 10), with a non-halogenated borate-based anion ([BOB]), have been studied at charged interfaces using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and neutron reflectivity (NR). For all alkyl chain lengths, the SFG spectra show that the cation imidazolium ring responds to the surface charge by modifying its orientation with respect to the surface normal. In addition, the combination of SFG spectra with electrochemical NR measurements reveals that the longest alkyl chain length (n = 10) forms a bilayer structure at all charged interfaces, independent of the ring orientation. These results demonstrate the tunability of IL interfacial layers through the use of surface charge, as well as effect of the cation alkyl chain length, and provide valuable insight into the charge compensation mechanisms of ILs.},

This shows great tolerance of the initial model in the surface structure search. The MC software is provided on the web. One of the advantages of using the MC method is the precise estimation of uncertainty of the obtained parameters. However, the parameter uncertainty is largely underestimated when one assumes that the diffraction measurements at each scattering vector are independent. The underestimation is caused by the correlation of experimental error. A means of estimation of uncertainty based on the effective number of observations is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Thin protein films of gelatin molecules grown on flexible substrates have been utilized to fabricate moisture-induced energy-harvesting devices, which work as self-biased sensors. Adsorbed water molecules from ambient moisture generate protons inside the film. A proton transfer path is formed through the hydrogen-bonded water molecules with protein around 55% relative humidity condition, and the protons are transferred due to the gradient of absorbed water molecules within the protein films. The devices are capable of harvesting electric power up to 5.5 mu W/cm(2) with an induced voltage of 0.71 V. Our findings not only provide a futuristic clean power generation concept from protein film as flexible power generator but also demonstrate the use of the energy-harvesting devices as self-biased electronic sensors for various flexible and wearable applications. The devices showed exceptional performance as humidity sensors and have been used for flexible healthcare applications, such as continuous monitoring of breathing pattern and lateral mapping of moisture levels at the finger tip for monitoring the wound healing process. Nevertheless, the diode-like response of the devices with humidity has been found to be suitable as a self-biased humidity-controlled electronic switch.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Hf/ZrO2-based thin films have emerged as promising candidates for ferroelectric materials in various applications. However, achieving ferroelectricity with a low-temperature process has remained a challenging task. In this study, the atomic layer plasma treatment (ALPT) technique, where an in situ Ar plasma treatment is introduced into each cycle of atomic layer deposition (ALD), was used to achieve crystallization and ferroelectricity in as-deposited ZrO2 thin films at a low temperature of 250 degrees C. The ALPT treatment effectively contributes to a high-temperature annealing effect, leading to enhanced crystallization and densification of the films. In addition, the ALPT process also induces a transformation from paraelectric to ferroelectric orthorhombic phase in the as-deposited ZrO2 thin films, exhibiting a high ferroelectric switching polarization of 30 mu C cm(-2) along with great endurance characteristics up to 10(8) switching cycles. This study demonstrates that ALPT is an effective approach to enhance and tailor the crystallization and dielectric characteristics of nanoscale thin films at a low temperature, which is highly advantageous and demanded in a variety of applications and research fields encompassing nanoelectronic, energy storage, and biomedical devices.},

  abstract = {Unconventional superconductivity has been suggested to be present at the interface between bismuth and nickel in thin-film bilayers. In this work, we study the structural, magnetic, and superconducting properties of sputter deposited Bi/Ni bilayers. As-grown, our films do not display a superconducting transition; however, when stored at room temperature, after about 14 days our bilayers develop a superconducting transition up to 3.8 K. To systematically study the effect of low temperature annealing on our bilayers, we perform structural characterization with x-ray diffraction and polarized neutron reflectometry, along with magnetometry and low-temperature electrical transport measurements on samples annealed at 70 degrees C. We show that the onset of superconductivity in our samples is coincident with the formation of ordered NiBi3 intermetallic alloy, a known s-wave superconductor. We calculate that the annealing process has an activation energy of (0.86 +/- 0.06) eV. As a consequence, gentle heating of the bilayers will cause formation of the superconducting NiBi3 at the Ni/Bi interface, which poses a challenge to studying any distinct properties of Bi/Ni bilayers without degrading that interface.},

  abstract = {X-ray absorption linear dichroism of rutile TiO2 at the Ti K-edge provides information about the electronic states involved in the pre-edge transitions. Here, linear dichroism with high energy resolution is analyzed in combination with ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor analysis. It provides an assignment of the three pre-edge peaks beyond the octahedral crystal field splitting approximation and estimates the spatial extension of the corresponding final states. It is then discussed for the first time the X-ray absorption (XAS) of pentacoordinated titanium atoms due to oxygen vacancies and it is found that, similarly to anatase TiO2, rutile is expected to exhibit a transition on the low-energy side of peak A3. Its apparent absence in the experiment is related to the degree of p-d orbital mixing which is small in rutile due to its centrosymmetric point group. A recent XAS linear dichroism study on anatase TiO2 single crystals has shown that peak A2 has an intrinsic origin and is due to a quadrupolar transition to the 3d energy levels. In rutile, due to its centrosymmetric point group, the corresponding peak A2 has a small dipole moment explaining the weak transition. The results are confronted with recent picosecond X-ray absorption spectroscopy on rutile TiO(2 )nanoparticles.},

X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show the crystallinity of the heterostructure deposited by ALD. After postdeposition annealing of the La-doped STO film in ultrahigh vacuum at 600 degrees C for 5 min, x-ray photoelectron spectra show the lack of La-dopant activation when the film is deposited on 10 nm-thick BTO. The same postdeposition annealing condition activates the La-dopant when LaxSr1 - xTiO3 films are deposited on STO-buffered Si(001) surfaces consisting of 2.8 nm of STO(001) on Si(001). Annealing of LaxSr1 - xTiO3 films sandwiched between BTO and STO-buffered Si(001) layers in air at temperatures <= 350 degrees C preserves the La-dopant activation. Piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrates the ferroelectric behavior of BTO films grown on LaxSr1 - xTiO3 surfaces. Sheet resistance and capacitance-voltage measurements further demonstrate the conductivity of the LaxSr1 - xTiO3 films sandwiched between the BTO film and the Si(001) substrate.},

The transformation of similar to 100-nm-thick CoxFe(80-x)B20 films from amorphous to polycrystalline was revealed by the sharpening of spectral features observed in optical and magneto-optical dielectric functions spectra. The influence of B on the dielectric function was assessed both experimentally and by optical modeling. By analyzing the Drude component of the optical dielectric function, a consistent trend between the charge-carrier scattering time/resistivity and the annealing temperature was observed, in agreement with the electrical investigations by means of the four-point-probe method.},

We observe an antiparallel ordering of the magnetic moments between the ferromagnetic LSMO layers and the LSCO spacers, leading to a strain-independent ferromagnetic ground state of the LSCO/LSMO heterostructures for LSMO layers as thin as two unit cells. As the LSMO thickness is increased, a net ferromagnetic state is maintained, however, the average magnetic moment per Mn is found to be dependent on the magnitude of the substrate-induced strain. The differences in the magnetic responses are related to preferential occupation of the Mn x(2) - y(2) (in-plane) d orbitals for tensile strain and 3z(2) - r(2) (out-of-plane) orbitals under compressive strain, leading to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions within the LSMO layers. These results underscore the relative contributions of orbital, structural, and spin degrees of freedom and their tunability in atomically thin crystalline complex oxide layers.},

Continuous tailoring of the multilevel remanence states by spin-orbit torque (SOT) is reported in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/IrMn heterostructures. Double-biased hysteresis loops with only one remanence state can be tuned from the positively or negatively single-biased loops by SOT controlled sign of the exchange-bias field. The remanence states associated with the heights of the sub-loops are continually changed by tuning the ratio of the positively and negatively oriented ferromagnetic domains. The multilevel storage cells are demonstrated by reading the remanent Hall resistance through changing the sign and/or the magnitude of current pulse. The synaptic plasticity behaviors for neuromorphic computing are also simulated by varying the remanent Hall resistance under the consecutive current pulses. This work demonstrates that SOT is an effective method to tailor the remanence states in the double-biased heavy metal/ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic system. The multilevel-stable remanence states driven by SOT show potential applications in future multilevel memories and neuromorphic computing devices.},

After final deposition of the Pd capping layer, the magnetic profile is structurally and magnetically symmetric across the Fe layer, with magnetism induced in Pd up to 0.92 nm from the interface.

  abstract = {Magnetic Heusler alloys X(2)BZ (where X and B are 3d elements and Z belongs to the sp group) exhibit diverse magnetic and structural properties, which are important for designing multifunctional smart materials. Electronic band structure calculations demonstrate that, if the valence of element B is higher than that of element X, such alloys (so-called inverse Heusler alloys) can behave differently as compared to traditional Heusler alloys. The growth, the crystal structure, and the magnetic properties of thin films of a new Mn2FeSi Heusler alloy deposited under various conditions (including various substrates and annealing temperatures) are studied in this work. A temperature-induced structural transition into a low-magnetization martensitic phase and a thermally stable austenitic phase are detected. A magnetic field of 500 Oe applied to some samples at a temperature of 380 K is found to cause a large exchange bias (about 1 kOe) at T = 10 K. The influence of the type of substrate and the annealing temperature on the magnetic and structural properties of the films is discussed.},

  abstract = {The working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of dye molecules adsorbed onto nanoparticles of a semiconductor such as TiO2. A reliable prediction of the DSSC photovoltaic performance of a given dye requires in-depth knowledge about the precise structure of the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interface. X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) are herein employed to determine the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structure and associated dye aggregation behavior of three high-performance DSSC dyes, i.e., a metal-free organic dye, MK-2, and the two archetypal ruthenium-based organometallic dyes, N3 and N749 (Black Dye). Results show that all three dyes form nanoaggregates in dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces. We determine the dye nanoaggregate separations, sizes, distribution densities, and the extent of short-range order within each dye self-assembly in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 composites fabricated using dye solutions of varying concentrations are analyzed. We find that nanoaggregates of the three dyes are separated by several hundred nanometers (158-203 nm) in dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfaces that have been fabricated using concentrated dye solutions (0.5 mM or 1.0 mM). MK-2 and N749 dyes also display smaller interparticle separations. Dye nanoparticle diameters are of the order of 156-198 nm, sizes that are comparable to the largest interparticle separations. Thus, no extraneous dye particles can be fitted into gaps between particles, so the dye self-assembly is saturated. Self-assemblies of all three dyes exhibit both lateral and longitudinal short-range order; N3 displays a particularly short coherence length along the TiO2 surface, with extensive structured disorder along the longitudinal direction. The operation of DSSC working electrodes would therefore seem to be dependent on a dye self-assembly that may exhibit several levels of structural granularity and dye aggregation effects.},
